## 2026-09-25 — Loop bootstrap (chat session)

- Build phase opened by owner directive: Lokma-style loop, start building; code first, deploy later (dev target: omnion.fermag.com.tr).
- Created: `docs/BUILD-BACKLOG.md` (P00→P14 + gated P-DEP) + this log + `omnion-build` cron loop (pinned model).
- Toolchain status: node 22 ✓ · pnpm 11 ✓ · bun ✓ · docker 29 ✓ · gcc 13 ✓ · **Rust NOT installed → P00 installs rustup**.
- Next: **P00 — Toolchain + repo skeleton.**

## 2026-09-25 — P00 · Toolchain + repo skeleton

- Rust toolchain installed via rustup (minimal, stable): `cargo 1.98.1` · `rustc 1.98.1`.
- Workspace: root `Cargo.toml` (resolver 2, members `apps/api` + `crates/*`) + `rust-toolchain.toml` (stable, rustfmt + clippy).
- `apps/api` (thin HTTP layer, docs/04): `src/lib.rs`, `main.rs`, `state.rs`, `routes/{mod,health}.rs` —
  `GET /healthz` → `{"ok":true,"service":"omnion-api","version":"0.1.0"}`, `PORT` env (default 8080, invalid value fails fast);
  `crates/core`: `omnion-core` infrastructure lib exposing `BuildInfo`, consumed by the API state.
- Infra: `infra/compose/docker-compose.dev.yml` (+ `postgres.yml`, `redis.yml`, `minio.yml`, `mailpit.yml`) with overridable
  host ports; `.gitignore` gains `target/`; CI skeleton `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (fmt · clippy `-D warnings` · test + compose config check).
- Proof: `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` → Finished ✅ · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` → clean ✅ ·
  `cargo test --workspace` → 2 passed (router `/healthz` integration test + core metadata) ✅ ·
  `curl -i 127.0.0.1:8080/healthz` → `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` body `{"ok":true,"service":"omnion-api","version":"0.1.0"}` ✅ ·
  `PORT=18080` → 200 ✅ · `docker compose -f infra/compose/docker-compose.dev.yml config --quiet` → valid, services
  `postgres, redis, minio, mailpit` ✅.
- CI on GitHub: workflow run `36193827205` → **success** (jobs: `Rust — fmt · clippy · test` ✅ · `Infra — compose config` ✅).
- Repo note: this clone's `origin` moved to the SSH URL — the stored OAuth token has no `workflow` scope, so over HTTPS GitHub rejects any commit touching `.github/workflows/`.
- Next: **P01 — Core foundations** (typed env config + tracing subscriber + shared error type, sqlx/Postgres pool + `database/migrations/0001_initial.sql`, `GET /readyz` with DB + Redis pings).

## 2026-09-25 — P01 · Core foundations

- `crates/core` gained the shared infrastructure layer: typed `config` (OMNION_* keys, `PORT` fallback,
  validation for environment/port/pool size/URL schemes, pretty-vs-JSON log defaults), `telemetry`
  (tracing subscriber with the OpenTelemetry layer hook plus a shutdown handle), `error`
  (`ConfigError` + `CoreError`), `db` (SQLx pool + embedded migration runner) and `redis_client`
  (lazily connected handle that reconnects without a restart).
- `database/migrations/0001_initial.sql`: organizations, users (case-insensitive unique email),
  sessions (hashed tokens only) and an append-only `audit_log` whose `actor_type` also covers the
  AI Hub audit chain.
- `apps/api` boots config → telemetry → database + migrations → redis → HTTP, with SIGTERM/Ctrl-C
  graceful shutdown. `GET /readyz` pings both dependencies — `200` only when everything answers,
  `503` with detail in development — and `ApiError` maps core errors onto the HTTP surface (`503`
  for an unavailable dependency, `500` otherwise).
- Proof: `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
  clean · `cargo test --workspace` → **27 passed** (20 core unit · 3 api unit · 1 healthz ·
  3 readyz integration against the live compose stack) · live run: `GET /healthz` → `200
  {"ok":true,…}` and `GET /readyz` → `200 {"checks":{"database":{"status":"ok"},"redis":{"status":"ok"}}}` ·
  `_sqlx_migrations` shows version 1 "initial" with `success = t`, and `\dt` lists
  organizations · users · sessions · audit_log · failure path: with Redis stopped, `/readyz` → `503
  redis unavailable (broken pipe)` while `/healthz` stayed `200`, and it returned to `200` without
  restarting the API once Redis was back.
- Dev stack: `docker compose -f infra/compose/docker-compose.dev.yml up -d` now really starts all four
  containers (postgres 5433 · redis 6380 · minio 9000/9001 · mailpit 1025/8025). Upstream MinIO images
  are no longer published on Docker Hub (`pull access denied`), so `infra/compose/minio.yml` pulls the
  community mirror `pgsty/minio` — the same server binary.
- CI: the Rust job now provisions PostgreSQL + Redis service containers (so the readiness integration
  tests run for real) and adds a smoke step that boots the API and curls `/healthz` + `/readyz`.
- CI run `36195108450` → **success** (Rust job `1m51s`, Infra job `5s`): the readyz suite passed 3/3
  against the service containers and the smoke step logged `listening address=0.0.0.0:8080`,
  `{"ok":true,…}` for `/healthz`, `{"checks":{"database":{"status":"ok"},"redis":{"status":"ok"}}}` for
  `/readyz`, then `shutdown signal received` after SIGTERM.
- Next: **P02 — Identity v0** (users + argon2, sessions, login/logout, first-admin bootstrap,
  integration tests).

## 2026-09-25 — P02 · Identity v0

- New crate `crates/identity` (docs/07-IAM.md subset): `users` (create/find by email or id,
  lowercase-normalized addresses, case-insensitive uniqueness), `password` (Argon2id hashing on the
  blocking pool, minimum length policy, `dummy_verify` so unknown addresses burn the same work as
  wrong passwords), `sessions` (256-bit hex tokens; only the SHA-256 hash is stored; 30-day TTL;
  resolve/touch/revoke) and `authentication` (`authenticate` returns Authenticated /
  InvalidCredentials / AccountDisabled — account status is only disclosed after the password
  verified).
- `crates/core` config gains `OMNION_ADMIN_EMAIL` + `OMNION_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (both-or-neither
  validation, password redacted from `Debug`); `apps/api` boot now seeds the first administrator on
  an empty database (`bootstrap_first_admin`, idempotent and race-safe) and logs why it skipped
  otherwise.
- API surface: `POST /api/v1/auth/login` (session cookie `omnion_session`, HttpOnly + SameSite=Lax,
  `Secure` outside development, Max-Age 30 days) · `GET /api/v1/me` — backed by a `CurrentSession`
  extractor (401 `unauthenticated` / `invalid_session`) · `POST /api/v1/auth/logout` (204, revokes and
  clears). Identity errors map onto the HTTP surface through `ApiError` (exhausted pool → 503).
  `ClientAddress` extractor captures the peer IP for `sessions.ip_address` without requiring
  connect-info (axum has no optional `ConnectInfo`), and the server is served with
  `into_make_service_with_connect_info`.
- Proof: `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
  clean · `cargo test --workspace` → **65 passed** (identity 18 · core 23 · api unit 14 · health 1 ·
  readyz 3 · auth integration 6 — including bootstrap on a throwaway database and revoke-after-logout)
  · live run on `:18080` against the compose stack: boot log `first administrator account created`,
  `/healthz` 200, `/readyz` 200 both checks ok, login 200 + `set-cookie: omnion_session=…; Path=/;
  HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax; Max-Age=2592000` with a 64-char token, `/me` 200 with the account JSON,
  `/me` without cookie 401 `unauthenticated`, logout 204 + `Max-Age=0`, replayed revoked token 401
  `invalid_session`, wrong password 401 `invalid_credentials`; database check: `admin@omnion.test`
  row with `$argon2id$v=19$…`, one session row with a hash that is not the token, `revoked = t`,
  `seen = t`.
- CI: the smoke step now seeds the admin and walks login → me → anonymous 401 → logout.
- CI run `36196441876` → **success**: `Rust — fmt · clippy · test` ✅ (1m11s — the identity suite ran
  against the service containers) · `Infra — compose config` ✅ (4s).
- Next: **P03 — IAM v0** (roles, permissions, role bindings, `require(permission)` guard, audit
  writes, role seeds from docs/07 §3).

## 2026-09-25 — P03 · IAM v0

- New crate `crates/permissions` (docs/07-IAM.md): the permission catalogue (32 keys across
  content/media/users/plugins/deployment/iam/audit), fully custom roles with priority, an inheritance
  link and flag, explicit allow/deny entries and scoped role bindings (global / organization / site,
  `expires_at` for temporary roles). `evaluate::RoleGraph` is a pure, deterministic resolver for the
  documented precedence — explicit deny > explicit allow > inherited allow > default deny — and it
  reports the provenance of every verdict (the seed of the permission simulator, §18). `crates/audit`
  is the append-only trail writer (§13, §19) reused by later AI-agent actions.
- Migration `0002_iam.sql`: `permissions`, `roles` (platform vs organization roles, key unique per
  scope), `role_permissions` (allow/deny, one row per key) and `role_bindings` (scope shape enforced by
  a check constraint, live combinations unique, `site_id` gains its foreign key with P04).
- `apps/api`: `require(permission)` guard (`src/guards.rs`) wraps routes, resolves the session once and
  hands it to the handler through the request extensions; privileged actions write audit rows in the
  same request. New `/api/v1/iam` surface: permissions, roles (GET/POST), role permissions (PUT),
  bindings (GET/POST), effective-permissions (own set without a permission, others need
  `iam.roles.read`) and audit (GET, `audit.read`). Boot seeds the catalogue and the six base roles
  (§3) and keeps the "at least one Owner" invariant (§20), auditing the fallback binding as a platform
  action.
- Fixed: adding a migration did not rebuild `omnion-core`, so the embedded migrator kept the old set
  and `0002` silently never applied (`relation "permissions" does not exist`). `crates/core/build.rs`
  now emits `cargo:rerun-if-changed=../../database/migrations`.
- Proof: `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
  clean · `cargo test --workspace` → **95 passed** (permissions 20 unit incl. deny/inheritance/cycle
  cases · audit 2 · api unit 17 · identity 18 · iam integration 4 against the compose stack).
- Live run on `:18081` against the compose stack: boot log `permission catalogue and base roles ready
  permissions=32`; `/healthz` 200 and `/readyz` both checks ok; anonymous `/api/v1/me` 401 and
  `/api/v1/iam/roles` 401; a signed-in session without a role gets `403 permission_denied` naming
  `iam.roles.read`; after the platform Owner binding `GET /iam/roles` → 200 with the ladder (`owner
  p1000 allow=32`, `administrator p900 allow=32`, `manager p700 allow=21`, `moderator p500 allow=9`);
  `POST /iam/roles` 201, `PUT /iam/roles/{id}/permissions` 200, `POST /iam/bindings` 201, editing a
  platform role 403 `system_role`; `/api/v1/iam/audit` lists `iam.binding.granted`,
  `iam.role.permissions_updated` and `iam.role.created` with actor, target and metadata, and the same
  rows are in `audit_log`.
- CI: the smoke step now also walks the gated surface (roles + own effective set, anonymous 401 for
  roles/audit). Run `36197985861` → **success**: `Rust — fmt · clippy · test` ✅ (1m06s; the smoke log
  shows `permission catalogue and base roles ready permissions=32`, the six base roles with the
  documented priorities and allow counts 32/32/21/9/8/2, the administrator's global Owner binding and
  the resolved effective set) · `Infra — compose config` ✅.
- Next: **P04 — Tenancy v0** (organizations, sites, domains + CRUD API, scope enforcement,
  cross-tenant denial tests).

## 2026-09-25 — P04 · Tenancy v0

- Migration `0003_tenancy.sql` (docs/01-VISION.md §10, docs/07-IAM.md §7): `sites` (one property
  of one organization, `key` unique per organization) and `site_domains` (host unique
  platform-wide, at most one primary per site through a partial unique index). The site-scoped
  role binding finally gets its foreign key; the narrow pre-constraint cleanup retires bindings
  that pointed at no site, so the constraint applies on an existing database.
- `crates/identity` grows the tenancy store: `organizations` (create/read/list/update/delete with
  slug, name and status validation) and `sites` (site and domain CRUD, host validation, automatic
  first-primary plus promotion on removal, `find_site_by_host` — the routing primitive P07 builds
  on). `IdentityError` learns the tenancy variants; `apps/api/src/error.rs` maps them
  (404 not-found, 409 taken, 400 shape).
- `crates/permissions`: new `tenancy` category — `organizations.read|manage`,
  `sites.read|create|update|delete`, `domains.manage`; the Manager ladder gains site management
  and Moderator/Editor `sites.read`; `bindings::validate` now refuses a site scope that names an
  unknown site or one of another organization.
- `apps/api`: `/api/v1/organizations` (GET/POST/GET id/PATCH/DELETE) and `/api/v1/sites`
  (GET/POST/GET id/PATCH/DELETE) plus `/{id}/domains`, `/{id}/domains/{domain_id}` and
  `/{id}/domains/{domain_id}/primary`, all behind the new guards. The shared `scope.rs` helpers
  carry the tenancy rule — an account with a primary organization stays inside it, opening and
  deleting a tenant is platform-only — and `routes/iam.rs` now uses them instead of its own
  copies. Deleting a tenant requires it to be empty (`409 organization_not_empty`).
- Proof: `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
  clean · `cargo test --workspace` → **119 passed** (identity 27 · permissions 22 · core 23 · api
  unit 26 · auth 6 · health 1 · iam 4 · readyz 3 · tenancy 5 integration against the compose
  stack, incl. cross-tenant denial and restore-free domain promotion).
- Live run on `:18082` against the compose stack (Owner session, P03 pattern): `/healthz` and
  `/readyz` both ok; anonymous `/api/v1/sites` and `/api/v1/organizations` 401; tenant 201,
  duplicate slug 409 `organization_slug_taken`; site 201, duplicate key 409 `site_key_taken`; first
  host primary, second non-primary, promotion 200, list primary-first; platform patch 200; domain
  removed 204 with the remaining host promoted; site 204; tenant 204 and `GET` 404; `site.created`,
  `site.domain.added`, `site.domain.primary_changed`, `site.updated`, `site.domain.removed`,
  `site.deleted`, `organization.created`, `organization.updated` and `organization.deleted` rows
  in `audit_log` with actor, target and metadata.
- Cross-tenant, live: an organization account (its own role with the tenancy keys, bound at
  organization scope) sees exactly its own organization and site and may create inside them, while
  every read of the other tenant — organization, site, domains, `?organization_id=` filter — and
  every write (`POST /sites` with the other organization, `POST /sites/{other}/domains`, PATCH,
  DELETE) answers **403 cross_organization**; the same calls on its own site answer 200/201. An
  account without a role gets **403 permission_denied** on the way to the handler; opening a
  tenant, and deleting its own, answer **403 platform_only** while renaming it is 200; a
  site-scoped binding that names another tenant's site is refused with `invalid_request`
  (“the site belongs to another organization”). The dev database was left clean
  (organizations 0 · sites 0 · domains 0 · 6 base roles · 1 owner binding).
- Noted for operators: base roles keep the permission set they were created with, so an
  installation that upgrades keeps the new tenancy keys on the Owner only — a tenant grants them
  to a role of its own (proven live); the seed's Owner sync is what keeps the platform owner
  complete.
- CI: the smoke step now also opens a tenant, a site and a domain and re-checks the anonymous 401s;
  the block was rehearsed locally against the built binary before pushing.
- CI run `36199468683` → **success**: `Rust — fmt · clippy · test` ✅ (119 tests, including the five
  tenancy integration tests; the smoke log shows tenant `smoke-organization`, site `main` and domain
  `smoke.omnion.test` with `"is_primary":true` created against the CI service containers) ·
  `Infra — compose config` ✅.
- Next: **P05 — Content v0** (pages + revisions, draft/published, publish/restore, slug rules,
  translations skeleton).

## 2026-09-25 — P05 · Content v0

- New crate `crates/content` (docs/05-VERSIONING.md §4–§7, docs/01-VISION.md §5, §7): `pages`
  (slug unique per site, `page_type`, lifecycle `draft`/`published`/`archived`, a pointer at the
  revision visitors see), `page_revisions` (append-only history with `revision_no`,
  title/body/summary and `restored_from_id`) and `translations` (one value of one field of one
  resource in one language — the content → translations[lang] model, no `title_tr` columns
  anywhere).
- The store keeps the documented rules: revision 1 is written with the page; editing content
  appends `n + 1` and archives the draft it supersedes; publishing freezes the draft, retires
  the revision it replaced and refuses with `no_draft_revision` when nothing is pending;
  restoring copies an older revision forward as a new draft (recording where it came from), so
  history is never rewritten; deleting a page takes its revisions and translation rows with it.
  Migration `0004_content.sql`; partial unique indexes hold "at most one draft, one published"
  in the database itself.
- API surface: `GET|POST /api/v1/pages`, `GET|PATCH|DELETE /api/v1/pages/{id}`,
  `POST /{id}/publish`, `POST /{id}/restore`, `GET /{id}/revisions[/{revision_id}]` and
  `GET|PUT /{id}/revisions/{revision_id}/translations[/{language}]`, all behind the
  `content.pages.*` guards plus the tenancy scope rule (a foreign page answers `403
  cross_organization`); every state change writes an audit row (`page.created`, `page.updated`,
  `page.published`, `page.revision.restored`, `page.translation.updated`, `page.deleted`).
- Proof: `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D
  warnings` clean · `cargo test --workspace` → **140 passed** (content crate 12 unit · api
  content routes 3 unit · 5 content integration against the compose stack). Live run on `:18083`
  against a fresh database (dropped afterwards): page `home` created as v1 draft; publish →
  `published_rev=1`; edit → v2 draft while v1 stayed live; publish → v2; re-publish →
  `no_draft_revision`; restore v1 → v3 draft with `restored_from=<v1>`; publish → v3 live;
  history `v3 published / v2 archived / v1 archived` with v1's row unchanged;
  `PUT .../translations/tr` → `tr/title = Merhaba`, `tr/body = Gövde`; anonymous `/api/v1/pages`
  → `401 unauthenticated`; `_sqlx_migrations` shows version 4 `content`; `audit_log` carries the
  seven `page.*` actions with revision numbers.
- CI: the smoke step now walks the content surface (create → publish → edit → publish → restore
  → translation) and re-checks the anonymous 401. Run `36200626747` → **success** (Rust job
  1m31s; the smoke log shows the page created as a draft, revised to "Welcome to Omnion", and
  the restore row `revision_no: 3, state: draft, restored_from_id: …`) · `Infra — compose
  config` ✅.
- Next: **P06 — Admin app v0** (`apps/admin` Next.js + TS + Tailwind with the API-wired login,
  app shell, pages list and site switcher; root `package.json` + `pnpm-workspace.yaml` +
  `turbo.json` skeleton).

## 2026-09-25 — P06 · Admin app v0

- The JavaScript/TypeScript side of the monorepo is alive: root `package.json` +
  `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (`apps/*`, `packages/*`) + `turbo.json` (`build`/`dev`/`typecheck`), so
  `pnpm build` at the root builds every app through turbo (verified: `1 successful, 1 total`).
- New app `apps/admin/` (Next.js 16 + React 19 + TypeScript 5.9 + Tailwind v4, docs/03-FRONTEND.md):
  the app shell (sidebar sections, sticky header with the current screen, mobile drawer), an
  API-wired sign-in screen, an overview screen with live workspace totals and the account card,
  the pages list of the selected site (state filter, live/draft revision per row, reload, empty
  and error states) and the sites list.
- Same-origin API access: `next.config.ts` forwards `/api/*` to `OMNION_API_URL` (default
  `http://127.0.0.1:8080`), so the API's HttpOnly session cookie stays first-party and no CORS
  rule is needed; a deployment only has to route `/api/*` at the edge.
- Session handling is server-first. `proxy.ts` (Next.js 16's renamed `middleware.ts`) turns
  visitors without a session cookie away from panel routes with a `307` to `/login`, the root
  layout resolves the account through `GET /api/v1/me` with the request's own cookie, and the
  client provider starts from that answer — the browser never probes the session itself, which
  keeps the console clean and shows no flash of protected UI.
- Tailwind v4 with `source(none)` + explicit `@source` roots: the repository also carries a Rust
  `target/` tree, so automatic content detection stays off and the app declares its own folders.
- Proof: `pnpm install` (2 workspace projects) · `pnpm --filter @omnion/admin run typecheck`
  clean · `pnpm --filter @omnion/admin run build` green (7 routes; `ƒ Proxy (Middleware)`) ·
  root `pnpm build` → turbo `1 successful, 1 total` · the compiled stylesheet carries the
  utilities the screens use (`bg-canvas`, `text-muted`, `border-line`, `sm:grid-cols-3`,
  `hover:bg-canvas`, …). Live walk on `:3100` against a fresh database (`omnion_p06_live`,
  dropped afterwards) with the API on `:8080`: seeded one tenant → one site → two pages (one
  published with a newer draft, one draft-only) through the API, then drove the panel in a real
  browser (Playwright): anonymous `/` → **307** to `/login`; a wrong password shows the API's
  own refusal (`email or password is incorrect`); the bootstrap account signs in and lands on
  the overview with totals `1 site / 2 pages / 1 published`; the switcher lists the site; the
  pages list shows `/home · live v1 · draft v2` and `/about · not published · draft v1`; the
  state filter narrows the list to the published page; the sites list marks the selected site;
  sign-out clears the cookie and a guarded route answers with `/login`. **17/17 checks passed,
  0 console errors** (the only rejected request in the whole walk is the deliberate wrong
  password on `/api/v1/auth/login`). Screenshot: `/tmp/omnion_p06_pages.png`.
- Next: **P07 — Public web v0** (`apps/web` server-side renderer for published pages + the
  `themes/minimal` stub, `GET /:slug` renders).

## 2026-09-25 — P07 · Public web v0

- The platform now *serves* a site, not just manages one. `crates/identity` gained
  `find_site_by_global_key` (a key resolves platform-wide only when exactly one site carries it —
  keys are unique per organization), and `apps/api` gained the **public surface**
  `GET /api/v1/public/pages/{slug}`: unauthenticated, published revisions only, and no internal
  identifiers in the payload (site key + name · page slug/type/updated_at · revision
  number/title/body/summary/published_at).
- Site resolution is part of the request, documented in `apps/api/src/routes/public.rs`: `?site=`
  (a host when it contains a dot, otherwise a key) → `X-Forwarded-Host`/`Host` with the port
  dropped → the installation's only site when there is exactly one. An address that matches
  nothing answers `404` — and it answers the *same* `404` for "unknown" and "not published", so
  the public surface never discloses a draft. An address that is not a slug shape is a `404` too,
  never a `400`: the panel's validation rules stay in the panel.
- New JavaScript side: `packages/types` (the public content shapes — types-only), `packages/theme-sdk`
  (the theme contract: `SiteTheme`, `PageLayoutProps`, `ThemeManifest`, `defineTheme`),
  `themes/minimal` (manifest + `PageLayout` + stylesheet; warm cream/ink/terracotta palette with a
  light/dark pair), and `apps/web` — Next.js 16 renderer where `app/[[...slug]]/page.tsx` serves the
  site's `home` page at `/` and any published page at `/{slug}` (`force-dynamic`, so a publish is
  visible without a rebuild), `lib/api.ts` reads the API server-side and forwards the visitor's host
  as the site hint unless it is a loopback address, `lib/theme.ts` is the theme registry, and
  `lib/metadata.ts` emits title/description plus canonical and Open Graph URLs when
  `OMNION_SITE_URL` is set. `pnpm-workspace.yaml` now includes `themes/*`.
- Proof: `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
  clean · `cargo test --workspace` → **145 passed** (api unit 33 incl. the new hint/host helpers ·
  public integration 2 · the rest unchanged) · `pnpm --filter @omnion/web run typecheck` clean ·
  `pnpm --filter @omnion/web run build` green (`ƒ /[[...slug]]` server-rendered on demand) · root
  `pnpm build` → turbo `2 successful, 2 total`.
- Live walk on a fresh database (`omnion_p07_live`, dropped afterwards; API on `:18090`, renderer on
  `:3200`): the draft answers `404` on the public surface; after publishing, the public read answers
  `200` through `?site=main`, through `Host: p07.omnion.test` and with no hint at all (single-site
  fallback); `GET /home` returns 7509 bytes of HTML containing the title, the body paragraph,
  `Powered by Omnion` and `data-theme="minimal"`; `GET /` serves the home page; `GET /` with
  `Host: p07.omnion.test` renders through the renderer's host forwarding; `/missing` and the
  draft-only `/soon` answer the not-found view; a revision published while the renderer kept running
  appeared in the HTML without a restart; the theme's stylesheet came back with its `--mn-accent`
  token.
- CI: the smoke step now also reads the published page through the public surface (by key and by the
  site's own domain), and it creates a page that is never published to assert the public `404`. The
  block was rehearsed locally against the built binary first (`SMOKE BLOCK REHEARSAL OK:
  public_title=Welcome to Omnion host_title=Welcome to Omnion draft=404`).
- CI run `36202889332` → **success**: `Rust — fmt · clippy · test` ✅ (the public integration suite
  ran in CI — `Running tests/public.rs` → `2 passed` — and the smoke log prints the public evidence:
  `public surface: title="Welcome to Omnion" via-key · "Welcome to Omnion" via-domain ·
  unpublished=404`) · `Infra — compose config` ✅.
- Next: **P08 — Media v0** (`crates/storage` S3/MinIO abstraction, upload endpoint, media table and
  the public serve path).

## 2026-09-26 — P08 · Media v0

- `crates/storage` (`omnion-storage`): the object-storage abstraction behind the media library —
  a key validator (`keys.rs`, the shape that cannot leave a storage root), SigV4 signing of its own
  S3 requests (`signing.rs`; unit-tested against the published example request — canonical request,
  string-to-sign and signature), an S3/MinIO driver (`s3.rs`: path-style addressing, `NoSuchBucket`
  → create the bucket and retry once, and a `probe` that tells a missing bucket from an unreachable
  store) and a file-system driver for local runs (`fs.rs`). `Storage::from_config`/`from_env` pick
  the driver from `StorageConfig` (`OMNION_STORAGE_DRIVER=s3|fs`, `OMNION_S3_*`, `OMNION_STORAGE_DIR`);
  the secret key is never rendered.
- `crates/media` (`omnion-media`): the row half — the `Media`/`NewMedia` model, the `media` table
  queries and the rules the outside world meets: `sanitize_filename` (path dropped, symbols reduced,
  extension kept), `normalize_content_type` (`type/subtype` only), `object_key` built from ids, and
  `serve_plan` — the inline allow-list (images, video, audio, PDF, `text/plain`); everything else
  leaves as `application/octet-stream` + `attachment` with `nosniff`, so an uploaded document can
  never become markup or script on the platform's own origin.
- `database/migrations/0005_media.sql`: one row per stored object (site, object key, file name,
  content type, size, SHA-256 checksum, uploader) with a unique object key, `size > 0` and shaped
  content-type/checksum constraints; sites cascade, so a removed tenant takes its library with it.
- API (`/api/v1/media`): `POST` (multipart, `media.upload`; the route's own body limit is the
  library's 25 MB plus framing slack; the row is written *after* the object is stored and the object
  is dropped again when the row is refused), `GET` list and metadata (`media.read`),
  `GET /{id}/raw` (`media.read`), `DELETE` (`media.delete` — object first, so a refused store never
  leaves bytes nothing points at). Every handler applies the tenancy scope rule through the site and
  writes an audit row (`media.uploaded`, `media.deleted`). The renderer's read path is
  unauthenticated like the rest of the public surface: `GET /api/v1/public/media/{id}`. `AppState`
  now carries the object store; boot logs `s3://omnion-media` and warns instead of failing when the
  store is down.
- `apps/admin`: the `/media` screen (new nav entry) — the library of the selected site with previews
  for image types, type/size/uploaded columns, an upload button (multipart through the panel's own
  origin) and per-row removal. `lib/api.ts` gained `fetchMedia`/`uploadMedia`/`deleteMedia`/
  `mediaRawUrl` and now only sets `content-type: application/json` for string bodies, so `FormData`
  keeps the browser's own multipart boundary; `lib/format.ts` gained `formatBytes`.
- Proof: `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
  clean · `cargo test --workspace` → **190 passed** (storage 25 · media 12 · api unit 40 · the new
  media integration suite **6** against the live compose stack) ✅ · root `pnpm build` for the admin
  app green (`ƒ /media` in the route table) ✅.
- Live walk (fresh database `omnion_p08_live`, API on `:18090`, admin on `:3100`, MinIO from
  `infra/compose`): sign-in → tenant + site → upload `omnion-media.txt` (19 B, `text/plain`,
  sha256 `11933807907f32bd…`) → the listing carries it with both read paths → `/raw` answers the very
  bytes (`cmp` identical, `type=text/plain`) and `/public/media/{id}` the same bytes with no session
  → anonymous `GET /api/v1/media` → `401` → `DELETE` → `204` → `/raw` afterwards → `404`; the object
  shows up in the MinIO data directory and is gone once deleted. Admin: Playwright signs in, opens
  `/media`, and the table lists `omnion-admin-fixture.txt` (`text/plain`, 27 B) — **the file is
  listed in the panel** ✅ with 0 console errors.
- Note for deployments: the admin's `/api/*` rewrite destination is baked at build time, so a panel
  pointed at a non-default API origin has to be *built* with `OMNION_API_URL` set; setting it only
  at `next start` answers `500` (`ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8080`).
- CI: a `Start the object store (media library)` step brings MinIO up the way `infra/compose` does
  (service containers cannot pass a command) and the smoke step now walks the media round trip —
  upload → list → `cmp` both read paths → anonymous `401` → delete → `404`. Run `36204518708` →
  **success**: `Rust — fmt · clippy · test` ✅ (the media integration suite ran in CI —
  `a_file_round_trips_from_upload_to_fetch ... ok`, `the_media_surface_is_permission_gated ... ok`,
  `an_upload_into_another_tenant_is_refused ... ok`, `test result: ok. 6 passed` — and the smoke log
  prints the media evidence: `media surface: library=1 file(s), first=omnion-media.txt 19 B
  text/plain · round-trip=ok · public=ok · removed=404`, after the new step printed
  `object store: 200`) · `Infra — compose config` ✅.
- Next: **P09 — Workflow engine v0** (`crates/workflows`: durable step store, background runner,
  step retries with backoff, wait-sweeper, manual + schedule triggers).

## 2026-09-26 — P09 · Workflow engine v0

- `crates/workflows` (`omnion-workflows`): the durable step engine behind the automation surface
  (docs/requests/REQ-003; design lessons from docs/09-N8N-TEARDOWN.md §13). A definition is a
  trigger plus an ordered step list — `definition.rs` (manual or cron schedule, 1–50 uniquely
  named steps, attempt cap five, waits 1 s–1 day), `cron.rs` (a five-field cron subset in UTC:
  lists, ranges, steps, month/weekday names, the classic day-of-month/day-of-week union — no
  dependency), `actions.rs` (the closed built-in action set `noop`, `echo`, `fail`, `transient`:
  no dynamic code in the core process, lesson 14), `store.rs` (the durable step store: claim,
  park, retry, settle, cancel, sweep — written so two instances racing over one row still hand
  each step to exactly one runner) and `engine.rs` (the policy: what one tick does, what the
  sweep repairs).
- Durable by construction: starting a run materialises one `workflow_steps` row per step, with
  `available_at` carrying both the retry backoff and the wait deadline. A wait parks the run (a
  write, not a sleep) and is resumed by the runner's next claim or by the sweep; a failing step
  is re-queued with an exponential backoff (5 s → 300 s by default) until its attempts run out;
  a claim older than the lease (5 min) is reclaimed by the sweep with an honest outcome — the
  next attempt for a task step, another park for a wait, and a clean failure when the lost
  attempt was the last one, so every run still reaches a terminal state.
- `database/migrations/0006_workflows.sql`: `workflows`, `workflow_executions`,
  `workflow_steps` with the constraints the engine leans on (status vocabularies, trigger shape,
  `attempts` never above the cap, one row per step position, cascade from the organization down).
- API (`/api/v1/workflows`, `/api/v1/workflow-executions`): create / read / replace / remove a
  definition, list its run history, read one run with every step, start a run and cancel one. The
  three new keys (`workflows.read`, `workflows.manage`, `workflows.run`) are catalogued and reach
  the operational roles (manager all three, moderator read+run, editor read). Definition changes
  and cancellations are audited by the handlers; the engine audits the run lifecycle
  (`workflow.execution.started|completed|failed|cancelled`).
- `apps/api/src/workflow_runner.rs`: the background runner — one task inside the API process, on
  by default — ticks the engine every `OMNION_WORKFLOW_TICK_MS` (default 1 s) and sweeps every
  `OMNION_WORKFLOW_SWEEP_SECONDS` (default 30 s); batch, scheduler batch and the retry base/max
  are configurable too (`OMNION_WORKFLOW_*`), and `OMNION_WORKFLOW_RUNNER=false` keeps a process
  from running the engine at all.
- Proof: `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D
  warnings` clean · `cargo test --workspace` → **250 passed, 0 failed** (workflows **36** unit
  tests · the new integration suite `apps/api/tests/workflows.rs` **11** against the live compose
  stack · every other suite unchanged) ✅
- Live walk (fresh database `omnion_p09_live`, API on `:18091`, runner tick 200 ms / sweep 1 s /
  retry base 400 ms): the Owner created a four-step workflow (noop → transient(`fail_times: 1`,
  3 attempts) → wait(2 s) → echo) and started it. The runner re-queued the failing step
  (`a failing step was re-queued … attempt=1 of=3 delay_ms=400`), parked the wait (`a wait step
  parked the run … seconds=2`), resumed it and finished the run — the API then read
  `completed step2.attempts=2 step3=succeeded step4=succeeded`. A second run parked on a 600 s
  wait was cancelled (`cancelled`, steps `cancelled`+`succeeded`), the second cancel answered
  `409 execution_not_running`. A `* * * * *` workflow fired by itself
  (`a scheduled workflow started …`) exactly once with `trigger=schedule`. The audit trail held
  9 rows (`started` ×3, `completed` ×2, `cancelled` ×1, `created` ×3) and both workflow routes
  answered `401` without a session.
- CI: the smoke step now walks a workflow as well — define the four-step run, start it, poll the
  execution until it settles, assert `completed` with `attempts=2` on the retried step, print the
  workflow audit rows, and prove `/api/v1/workflows` is closed to anonymous callers. Run
  `36206269819` → **success**: `Rust — fmt · clippy · test` ✅ (the workflow integration suite ran
  in CI — the eleven walks passed against the compose stack — and the smoke log prints
  `a failing step was re-queued … attempt=1 of=3 delay_ms=5000` for the retried step, then
  `workflow surface: completed attempts=2 wait=succeeded · run=completed` with
  `workflow audit rows: 19`) · `Infra — compose config` ✅.
- Next: **P10 — Onboarding v0 (REQ-050)** (first-run wizard + `omnion` CLI skeleton).

### Lessons

- A wait step must be resumable whichever mechanism wakes it: deciding "park or resume" from the
  status the row had before the claim broke as soon as the sweeper re-queued a due wait — the
  parked step parked itself again (caught by the attempts constraint as a `23514`). Deciding on
  the claim count (`attempts > 1` ⇒ resume) makes the runner's claim and the sweep agree, and the
  database constraint turned a silent double-park into a failing test.
- An audit row is a second write: a probe that reads the state the moment it flips can land in
  the millisecond before the audit arrives. Positive audit assertions must poll (state → audit is
  the deliberate order); keep the negative ones reading immediately.
- A claim is a LEASE, not a lock. A runner that stops mid-step leaves a `running` row whose
  attempt is already counted, and nothing else would move it again: the run would stay open
  forever and block its own later steps. The sweep reclaims claims older than the lease.
- Test-fleet hygiene: a panicking test skips its cleanup, and the next run's engine ticks walk
  into those rows (a leftover wait at its attempt cap failed an unrelated suite with a constraint
  error). Sweep the suite's own prefix once per process (`OnceCell`) before fixtures appear, and
  keep the test runner's lease longer than any test step so the reclaim path only fires in the
  walk that asks for it.

## 2026-09-26 — P10 · Onboarding v0 (REQ-050)

- `crates/onboarding` (`omnion-onboarding`): the first run of an installation as one flow both
  front ends drive — `steps.rs` (owner account → organization → first site with its domain →
  theme → AI decision → close), `state.rs` (the `onboarding_state` singleton, the derived step
  status and the summary) and `checklist.rs` (the getting-started items, derived from the
  platform's own rows). The owner step binds the Owner role through the same seeding path the API
  runs at boot; every step is audited; an installation whose first account came from the
  environment bootstrap finishes its first run through the wizard too (the oldest active account
  acts as its owner).
- `database/migrations/0007_onboarding.sql`: `sites.theme` (the presentation setting the renderer
  activates) and the `onboarding_state` singleton, one timestamp per step.
- `tools/cli` (`omnion-cli`, binary `omnion`): `setup` (interactive, flag-driven or fully
  non-interactive; the password never echoes), `doctor` (six checks in boot order, actionable
  hints, non-zero exit when one fails) and `migrate` (before/after migration status). The CLI
  reads the same typed configuration the API does and runs the same flow code.
- `apps/api`: `/api/v1/onboarding` — `GET` (open: how far the first run has come) plus `owner`,
  `organization`, `site`, `theme`, `ai-provider` and `complete`, guarded by the flow itself (no
  permission guard: there is nothing to check against before an account exists). The site body
  and the public page response carry the site's theme now, and `PATCH /sites/{id}` accepts one.
- `apps/admin`: the `/setup` wizard (five steps + done screen, Lucide icons only, resumable from
  the server's step status), a sign-in redirect for a fresh installation, the getting-started
  checklist card on the dashboard and a theme selector on Sites. `apps/web` resolves the theme the
  site carries, so choosing one changes what visitors see.
- Proof: `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D
  warnings` clean · `cargo test --workspace` → **272 passed, 0 failed** across 32 suites (the new
  `crates/onboarding` unit tests and `apps/api/tests/onboarding.rs` — four walks on throwaway
  databases) ✅
- Live walks (each on a database created empty for the run):
  1. **wizard surface over HTTP** (`:18092`): `needs_setup` → owner (auto sign-in) → organization
     → site+domain → an unknown theme refused (`400 unknown_theme`) → theme → AI skip → complete;
     the owner then reads `/organizations` and `/sites` through the regular API; six
     `onboarding.*` audit rows; a second owner attempt answers `409 already_installed` and an
     anonymous step `401` ✅
  2. **the browser** (admin panel `:3101` against API `:18094`, Chromium under Xvfb): 10/10 checks
     with 0 console errors — all five steps walk, the dashboard shows the checklist (6 items, 2
     open), Sites shows the theme select, and a finished installation redirects `/setup` back to
     the panel; read back from the database: 1 user, 1 organization, 1 site (`theme=minimal`),
     1 domain, `onboarding_completed=true` ✅
  3. **the CLI** on a fresh database: `doctor` fails on an unmigrated schema (exit 1, hint
     `omnion migrate`), `migrate` applies 7 migrations, `doctor` passes, `setup --non-interactive`
     creates everything, the API serves it (login + the site with its theme), and a second
     `setup` is refused with exit 2 ✅
- CI: the smoke job builds the CLI too and runs a first-run walk on a database that has never been
  migrated (`omnion doctor` refuses the unmigrated schema, `migrate` applies it, `setup` creates
  the installation, the API serves it). Run `36208527271` → **success** (the walk prints
  `doctor reported the pending schema (exit 1, as expected)`, `Setup complete.` …
  `onboarding: completed · steps {'owner': True, …} · themes ['minimal']`,
  `site: ci-site theme=minimal`) · `Infra — compose config` ✅
- Also fixed: the P09 workflow suite's walks are serialised behind a walk lock — its sweeps work
  on the whole `workflows` table, so two walks in flight could settle each other's rows (4 of 5
  runs failed before the lock, 5 of 5 pass after).
- Next: **P11 — AI Hub v0** (docs/06: provider abstraction, providers/models tables, streaming
  chat endpoint, provider configuration in the admin panel).

### Lessons

- An onboarding flow must be *derived*, not remembered: every step's status comes from the
  platform's own rows (accounts, organizations, sites, the theme on the site), so a refresh, a
  second tab, or an installation set up through the API directly all resume correctly without a
  client-side state machine.
- A wizard's first step cannot require a session: the endpoint that creates the owner account is
  open by necessity, so its safety has to come from the data rule (only while the installation
  has no accounts at all) — with the unique index as the backstop for two callers racing.
- The admin panel bakes `rewrites()` into the build: pointing it at a different API origin only
  takes effect after `next build`, so a browser walk must build the panel for the API port it
  will talk to (a runtime env var is not enough).
- This container's Chromium refuses `Page.captureScreenshot` even under Xvfb: a browser walk has
  to treat pictures as a bonus and assert on the DOM (step-state attributes, checklist items,
  console errors) instead of on screenshots.
- Two walks that share a table-wide repair pass cannot run at once: `engine::sweep` is
  deliberately global, so the workflow suite now holds a walk lock — determinism is worth the
  extra ~17 s of serial runtime, and a flake that fails 4 of 5 runs is a bug, not weather.

## 2026-09-26 — P11 · AI Hub v0 (docs/06)

- New crate `crates/ai-hub` (`omnion-ai-hub`) — the platform's single door to AI. `model.rs` holds
  the stored shapes and their validation (a provider is a name, a protocol, a base URL and a
  write-only key; a model is a wire key plus the capability metadata of docs/06 §3); `store.rs`
  keeps the two data rules the rest of the platform leans on — at most one default provider, and a
  default model that is always an enabled one (a switch-off, a removal, a replaced model list or a
  deleted provider repairs the default, or leaves the installation without one — never with a
  model that cannot answer); `client.rs` is the OpenAI-compatible wire client (`chat`,
  `stream_chat` with an SSE decoder built against frames rather than chunks, and
  `list_remote_models`); `router.rs` resolves a request to one `(provider, model)` pair — an
  explicit `provider/model`, a bare key searched across the enabled providers (default provider
  first, and a model key may itself carry a slash), or the installation's default model.
- `database/migrations/0008_ai_hub.sql`: `ai_providers` + `ai_models`, with the partial unique
  indexes that make the two rules the database's own (one default provider, one default model),
  case-insensitive provider names, a base-URL shape check and a cascade from a provider to its
  models.
- Permissions: `ai.providers.read`, `ai.providers.manage` and `ai.chat` (category `ai`) —
  connecting an endpoint and using the platform's AI are separate powers. Manager reads the
  registry and chats (managing providers stays with Owner/Administrator), moderator and editor
  chat, member holds none of them.
- API (`/api/v1/ai`): providers list/create/patch/delete (the key goes in and never comes back —
  only `has_api_key` does), the model registry (`GET /ai/models`, `PUT /ai/providers/{id}/models`
  replaces a provider's set, `PATCH /ai/models/{id}` switches or defaults one), discovery against
  the provider itself (`POST /ai/providers/{id}/discover-models`) and `POST /ai/chat`, which
  answers as `text/event-stream`: `start` (the pair the router chose) → `delta` frames → `done`
  with the finish reason and the token usage, or `error` with a stable code. Every exchange is
  audited (`ai.chat.completed` / `ai.chat.failed`) with provider, model and usage.
- `apps/admin`: the `/ai` screen (sidebar entry; provider list with enable / make-default /
  models / remove; a connect form with the key write-only; a model editor with "Discover from
  provider"; the registry with capability flags and default/enable switches; and a Try-it chat
  that streams an answer through the whole chain). `lib/api.ts` gained the typed client, including
  a browser-side `streamChat` that parses the SSE frames.
- `infra/mocks/openai-compatible.mjs`: a dependency-free OpenAI-compatible mock (models list, JSON
  and streamed chat, and a model it refuses with `500`) so the round trip is reproducible locally
  and in CI without a vendor key.
- Proof: `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D
  warnings` clean · `cargo test --workspace` → **303 passed, 0 failed** (ai-hub 26 unit
  tests; `apps/api/tests/ai_hub.rs` is new) · `pnpm --filter @omnion/admin build` green with the
  `ƒ /ai` route and `pnpm --filter @omnion/admin typecheck` clean.
- Live walk (fresh database `omnion_p11_live`, API `:18096`, mock on `:8123`): sign-in; connect
  `Local Mock` (`http://127.0.0.1:8123/v1/` — the trailing slash normalized away, key stored,
  `model_count 2`, no key anywhere in the responses); the registry lists both models with
  `Local Mock/mock-large` as the default; discovery returns the provider's own list; a chat
  addressed as `Local Mock/mock-large` streams `start` + 5 deltas + `done`
  (`chars=33 · total_tokens=12`) and reassembles to `Hello from the mock (mock-large).`; the same
  without a model named (the router takes the default); a model the provider refuses arrives as
  `event: error {"code":"provider_error", … 500 …}`; an anonymous chat is `401`; the audit trail
  holds 7 `ai.*` rows across five actions.
- Browser walk (admin panel `:3100` against the API, Chromium): **10/10** checks — sign-in, the
  sidebar entry, the provider row, the model rows with the default marked, a chat streaming
  through the UI (`Hello from the mock (mock-large).` · route `Local Mock · mock-large ·
  openai_compatible` · usage `33 characters · 12 tokens · stop`), a model becoming the default
  from its row, and 0 console errors.
- CI: a new `AI Hub walk (mock provider)` step starts the mock and a second API instance, connects
  the provider, streams a chat, asserts the reassembled answer, the `provider_error` frame and the
  anonymous `401`, and prints the `ai.*` audit rows. Its script was dry-run locally against the
  live stack first (`exit 0`, `ai chat stream: deltas=5 reassembled="Hello from the mock
  (mock-large)."`). Run `36210119981` → **success**: `Rust — fmt · clippy · test` ✅ (the walk
  printed `ai registry: 2 model(s), default=mock-large`, `ai chat stream: deltas=5
  reassembled="Hello from the mock (mock-large)."`, `ai audit rows: 4 [… ai.chat.completed ·
  ai.chat.failed · ai.provider.connected · ai.provider.models_replaced]` and `ai hub:
  provider=… · registry=ok · chat=streamed · refusal=reported · anonymous=401`) ·
  `Infra — compose config` ✅.
- Next: **P12 — Events + Webhooks v0** (event bus table + delivery worker + HMAC signatures, first
  fan-out `page.published`).

### Lessons

- A provider key is a one-way shape: the API's provider body has no field for it (`has_api_key` is
  derived), so "the key never comes back" is a grep over the responses rather than an audit of
  every handler — design the response type so a leak would need a new field.
- Two invariants belong to the schema, not to validation code: "one default provider" and "the
  default model is always enabled" are partial unique indexes plus one `repair_default_model` pass
  that every write path calls. The database refuses the impossible state; the store reforms it
  after each change.
- Streaming has two failure surfaces and both need an answer: everything decidable before the
  first byte stays an HTTP status (routing, permission, request shape), everything after it
  travels as an `error` frame inside the stream. A client that handles only one of them shows a
  half-answer, or a spinner that never stops.
- The SSE decoder is where a provider's personality is: it must survive a JSON object split
  mid-frame, CRLF frames, keep-alive comments, a missing trailing blank line, a usage frame after
  the finish reason, and a refusal smuggled inside a `200` stream. Write it against frames, never
  against "one chunk = one event" — and prove it with frame-level unit tests.
- Two mocks, two jobs: the in-process axum mock keeps the Rust suite hermetic; the zero-dependency
  Node mock makes the same round trip reachable from CI and from a laptop. The CI step's script
  was dry-run locally before it was committed — and the dry run found that 8081 on this box is the
  Pterodactyl Wings daemon, not a free port (`ss -tlpn` before trusting a port).

## 2026-09-26 — P12 · Events + Webhooks v0 (docs/01-VISION.md §13)

- New crate `crates/events` (`omnion-events`) — the platform's event bus and its deliveries.
  `model.rs` holds the recorded event, the endpoint, the queue rows and the attempt budget the
  queue carries; `validation.rs` the shapes the platform refuses to store (a dotted, lower-case
  event name, an absolute http(s) URL, a subscription list, the generated 32-byte secret);
  `signature.rs` the signing scheme (HMAC-SHA256 over `<timestamp>.<raw body>` carried as
  `X-Omnion-Signature: v1=<hex>`, verified in constant time); `store.rs` the SQL (event + fan-out
  in one transaction, `for update skip locked` claims with a lease, settle exactly once, the retry
  ladder); `bus.rs` `emit`/`emit_to`; `sender.rs` one signed POST — the body is serialized once and
  both the request body and the signature are computed from those bytes, so a receiver that
  verifies the raw bytes always agrees; and `engine.rs` `run_due`: settle the queue of endpoints
  that were switched off, claim the due rows, deliver, retry with backoff, fail when the attempts
  run out.
- `database/migrations/0009_events_webhooks.sql`: `events` (dotted-name check, organization/site/
  actor references), `webhook_endpoints` (per-organization case-insensitive unique name, the
  subscription array with a cardinality check, a secret-length check) and `webhook_deliveries`
  (one delivery per endpoint per event, `pending | delivered | failed`, attempts, lease, response
  status, error) with the partial index the claim walks.
- Fan-out: publishing a page records `page.published` (page, site, slug, revision) and the bus
  queues one signed delivery per enabled, subscribed endpoint of that organization — the event row
  and its deliveries are one transaction, so the queue can never reference an event that does not
  exist. An event without an organization fans out to nobody: an endpoint belongs to one tenant,
  and matching it against a platform-level fact would leak between tenants.
- API (`/api/v1/webhooks`, `/api/v1/events`): endpoints list/create/get/patch/delete, the
  operator's test delivery (`POST /webhooks/{id}/test` queues `webhook.test` — even to a
  switched-off endpoint, which is what "test before going live" means), the queue history of one
  endpoint (`GET /webhooks/{id}/deliveries`) and the event feed (`GET /events?name=&limit=`). The
  signing secret is write-only: shown once when the platform generated it, never again, and a
  rotation replaces it silently. Endpoints are tenant resources — an organization account only
  ever sees and changes its own (a cross-tenant read is `403 cross_organization`).
- Permissions: `webhooks.read`, `webhooks.manage`, `events.read` (categories `webhooks`, `events`);
  Manager reads endpoints and the feed, Owner/Administrator pick the new keys up from the catalogue.
- Runner: `apps/api/src/event_runner.rs` ticks the delivery queue in the API process
  (`OMNION_EVENTS_*`, default on) — `poll_ms` 5000, `batch` 20, `lease_seconds` 120,
  `request_timeout_ms` 10000, `retry_base_ms` 15000 → `retry_max_ms` 900000; a queued delivery
  carries its five attempts.
- `infra/mocks/webhook-receiver.mjs`: a dependency-free receiver that verifies the HMAC exactly the
  way a third-party receiver must (and answers `401` when it does not verify). `infra/mocks/
  webhooks-walk.sh`: the end-to-end walk — sign in, tenant + site + page, connect the receiver as
  an endpoint, publish, wait for the signed delivery, read it back from the queue history and the
  event feed. Developer and CI run the same script.

### Verify

- `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` + `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
  green; `cargo test --workspace`: **332 passed, 0 failed** (the events crate contributes 22 unit
  tests, the API suite 2 more walks).
- `apps/api/tests/events.rs` — 2 walks on throwaway databases against a **real receiver this suite
  starts on a loopback port**: connecting an endpoint (secret shown once, never again in any
  response body), the duplicate-name `409` and the unusable-URL `400`, the test delivery, the
  `page.published` fan-out (header + signature + envelope verified by the receiver's own verifier,
  the queue history showing `delivered / attempts=1 / 200`, the event feed showing the payload), a
  receiver that answers `500` once (the delivery stays `pending` with `attempts=1` and the refusal
  in `error`, then delivers on the retry with `attempts=2`), a receiver that never accepts (five
  attempts, then `failed` with `response_status=500` — the receiver saw every one), the tenant
  scope (two organizations, one event, only the owning organization's endpoint receives it and
  nothing is queued for the other), the permission gates (`401` anonymous, `403` for a member
  without the keys, `403` for cross-tenant reads) and the switched-off endpoint (its queued
  delivery settles as `failed` with the reason instead of sitting pending forever).
- Live walk on this machine — the API binary on `:8082` against a throwaway database plus
  `webhook-receiver.mjs` on `:8124`, driven by the committed `infra/mocks/webhooks-walk.sh`:
  `receiver: event=page.published signature=verified bytes=477 slug=home` ·
  `platform: status=delivered attempts=1 response=200 event=page.published` ·
  `bus: 1 page.published event(s) on the feed` · `webhooks walk: OK — signed delivery verified end
  to end`; the API's own log: `event recorded event_id=1 name=page.published deliveries=1` followed
  by `webhook delivered delivery_id=cc2ff733-b27f-4b62-aa41-e39e343e084c endpoint=Walk Receiver
  event=page.published status=200 attempt=1`.
- CI: the `Webhooks walk (signed delivery)` step starts the receiver and a second API instance and
  runs the same script (dry-run locally: exit 0).
- Next: **P13 — Automation v0 (REQ-003 lite)** — trigger → condition → action on top of P09.

### Lessons

- One transaction for "the fact" and "who must hear about it": an event row and its queued
  deliveries commit together, which removes the class of bug where a delivery points at an event
  that was never recorded. The trade-off is explicit — subscriptions are matched at emission time,
  so an endpoint connected later receives nothing retroactively.
- Sign the exact bytes you send. Serialize the body once, sign those bytes, put those bytes on the
  wire; a receiver that re-serializes a parsed body will verify in one language and fail in another
  (key order, unicode escaping, float formatting).
- The timestamp belongs inside the signed material: a receiver gets replay protection by comparing
  it with its own clock, and Omnion needs no extra state to make the promise.
- A queue row carries its own budget (`max_attempts`) and its attempts are counted when it is
  claimed, not when it succeeds — so a process that dies mid-delivery still consumes an attempt and
  a crash loop cannot retry forever.
- "Switched off" needs an answer for the queue too: pending deliveries of a disabled endpoint are
  settled as failed with the reason. Otherwise the history shows a queue that never moves and the
  operator cannot tell why nothing arrived.
- The last mile is the delivery id: `X-Omnion-Delivery` is the row's own id, which is what makes
  the receiver's log and the panel's delivery list talk about the same attempt.

## 2026-09-26 — P13 · Automation v0 (REQ-003 lite)

- New crate `crates/automation` (`omnion-automation`) — trigger → condition → action on top of the
  P09 engine, with the docs/09-N8N-TEARDOWN §13 lessons applied: an automation rule **is** a
  workflow whose `trigger_kind = 'event'` (storage reflects what it is — no parallel rule table),
  the comparison set is closed and small (9 operators: `equals`, `not_equals`, `contains`,
  `not_contains`, `starts_with`, `ends_with`, `in`, `exists`, `not_exists` — no expression
  language), and no dynamic code ever runs in the core process. `model.rs` the rule + run shapes;
  `condition.rs` the evaluator (every condition must hold; a field the payload does not answer is
  false, and the skip audit says why); `binding.rs` the `{{ }}` bindings an action may fill from
  the payload — a binding the event cannot fill **refuses to start** the run (no half-filled
  steps); `matcher.rs` the drain — **one tick = one transaction**: read the events above the
  cursor, evaluate the armed rules of their tenants, start one durable run per match, advance the
  cursor; `for update skip locked` makes the cursor row itself the concurrency lock, so
  exactly-once holds across instances.
- Cursor: seeded to the end of the bus **once at boot** (`matcher::seed_cursor`, called by
  `automation_runner` before its first tick) — a fresh installation watches forward; on an empty
  bus that seed lands on `0`, which is precisely why the drain reads everything above it. The
  lazy-seed branch inside the drain was removed: the E2E walk caught it swallowing the first real
  event (it re-read `0` as "never seeded" and stepped the cursor past the event the rule was
  waiting for).
- Actions: `send_email` — the SMTP wire protocol written out in `mail.rs` (`EHLO` → optional
  `AUTH PLAIN` → `MAIL FROM` → one `RCPT TO` per recipient → `DATA` → `QUIT`; multi-line replies
  read in full; dot-stuffed bodies), master switch `OMNION_MAIL_ENABLED`, and a switched-off
  server fails the step **with that reason** — and `comment_revision` — a comment on the revision
  the event names (`crates/content/src/comments.rs`). Synthetic actions (`noop`, `echo`, `fail`,
  `transient`) stay pure in-engine; they are what the suite drives the engine with.
- `database/migrations/0010_automation.sql`: the cursor row + the run table + the P09 constraint
  work the E2E walk exposed — `workflows_trigger_kind_valid` did not know `'event'` and
  `workflows_schedule_shape` had no event branch, so an event rule fell through both checks; both
  are dropped and re-added (three-branch shape), plus `trigger_event`/`conditions` columns and
  `workflows_trigger_event_shape`.
- API: `/api/v1/automations` (list/create/get/update/delete) + `/automations/catalogue` (the closed
  vocabulary a rule may be written in), reusing `workflows.read`/`workflows.manage`; rules are
  tenant resources and the surface is permission-gated. The matcher runs in the API process:
  `OMNION_AUTOMATION_RUNNER` (default on), `OMNION_AUTOMATION_POLL_MS`, `OMNION_AUTOMATION_BATCH`.
- Proof: `cargo fmt --all -- --check` → clean · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D
  warnings` → clean · `cargo test --workspace --lib` → **328 passed** · `cargo test -p omnion-api
  --tests` → **58 + 56 integration (13 files, incl. the new `tests/automation.rs`)**.
  `apps/api/tests/automation.rs` — 5 walks on a throwaway DB with a real in-process SMTP sink: the
  full page.published → conditions → `send_email` + `comment_revision` run end to end —
  `matcher: evaluated=1 matched=1 skipped=0 run=5029f197-…` · `engine: run="completed" step1={action:
  send_email, subject: "Published: Release notes", to: editor@example.com} step2={action:
  comment_revision, comment_id: 6d5b166d-…}` · `sink: to=editor@example.com subject="Published:
  Release notes" bytes=314 commands=5` — plus: a false condition and an unheard event start nothing,
  a binding the event cannot fill refuses the run, a switched-off mail server fails the step with
  that reason (`step_error="the email could not be sent: sending email is switched off
  (OMNION_MAIL_ENABLED=false)"`), and the surface stays permission-gated + tenant-scoped.
- Next: **P14 — Polish + CI v0** (make the CI workflow run for real + README quickstart).

## 2026-09-26 — P14 · Polish + CI v0

- CI gains the `Web — install · typecheck · build · serve (admin + public renderer)` job: pnpm comes
  from the root `packageManager` field (no version pinned twice), `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`,
  `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm build` (both Next.js apps through turbo), and then the panel is booted and
  has to keep the promise a reader cares about — the sign-in screen answers `200` while an anonymous
  panel route is redirected (`307`) to it. The job deliberately needs no API: it is what a fresh
  clone can show before anything is configured.
- README rewritten around a quickstart a fresh clone can follow: the compose stack (table of services
  and ports) → `cargo run -p omnion-api` → first run (`omnion setup` or the `/setup` wizard) → the
  admin panel → the public renderer, followed by the checks CI runs, the repository layout and the
  documentation map. Every command in it was executed on the dev stack first.
- Proof: CI run `36213754270` (head `3a8de29`) → **success**, all three jobs — the web job (40 s)
  logged `admin panel: /login=200 · anonymous /pages=307 → /login`, and `Rust — fmt · clippy · test`
  (smoke + AI-hub + webhooks + first-run walks) plus `Infra — compose config` stayed green. Local
  dry runs: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` → "Already up to date" · `pnpm typecheck` → 2/2 ·
  `pnpm build` → 2 successful · `/healthz` 200 · `/readyz` database+redis ok · `omnion doctor` 6/6.
- Next: **P15+ — REQ-driven queue** (`docs/requests/REQ-XXX`, owner steers priority; suggested first
  REQ-016 webhooks centre → REQ-002 command centre). The foundation phases P00–P14 are complete.

## 2026-09-26 — REQ-002 · Global search (slice 1: the index and the query core)

- The platform's search is an **index**, not a scatter of per-table queries: `crates/search` owns a
  provider registry (pages, media, users, sites — one entry each: key, document type, the read
  permission its hits require, the panel route a hit opens), an indexer that writes one
  `search_documents` row per searchable thing (`database/migrations/0012_search.sql`), and a query
  engine that narrows by organization, by the caller's provider permissions and by the scoped
  syntax (`type:`, `site:`, `owner:me`, `before:`/`after:`, `is:draft`) inside the SQL — never
  after paging. Ranking is `ts_rank_cd` over the document vector (title A / tags B / subtitle C /
  body D) with the installation's weights (normalised into the range PostgreSQL accepts) plus a
  `pg_trgm` prefix and near-miss match.
- The index keeps itself fresh from the bus: `apps/api/src/search_runner.rs` walks the events
  above a cursor row (`for update skip locked`) and applies each one to its provider;
  `POST /api/v1/search/reindex` rebuilds a provider (or all) idempotently — upsert plus prune, so
  a second pass writes the same count — and leaves an audit row and a `search.reindexed` event.
  The API surface is `/api/v1/search` (ranked hits, per-provider counts, honest hints),
  `/search/suggest` (title prefixes), `/search/status` and `/search/recent` (GET/DELETE). Two new
  permission keys: `search.read` (the box; every base role holds it) and `search.manage` (index
  operations).
- Proof: `cargo fmt --all -- --check` → clean · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D
  warnings` → clean · `cargo test --workspace` → **421 passed, 0 failed (44 suites)**, including
  the new `apps/api/tests/search.rs` (8 walks: hits across pages + media + users for a librarian
  while an editor without `users.read` gets none; tenancy scope with a platform owner reading
  across organizations; the scoped syntax with an unknown `type:` answering empty *and explained*;
  publishing a page becoming findable within one indexer tick; a reindex idempotent twice over;
  the media removal branch; suggestions; the search history; four refusals) · `pnpm typecheck &&
  pnpm build` → 2/2 successful · `bash scripts/qa/run.sh` → 49 clicks, 49 screenshots, **0 high
  findings, 0 vision issues** (`qa-artifacts/20260926-134405`).
- Deviations from the spec, each deliberate and recorded in the REQ: no dyn `SearchProvider` trait
  (the registry is the seam and the indexer is the single writer), `document` is a plain tsvector
  column (`array_to_string` is STABLE, and generated columns refuse STABLE expressions), weights
  are normalised (`ts_rank_cd` accepts only 0..=1), and the `users`/`sites` hits point at routes
  that arrive with REQ-006 — slice 2 renders a section only for a provider whose route exists, so
  no click goes nowhere.
- Next: **REQ-002 slice 2 — the palette** (header search box, ⌘K overlay, sections by hit count,
  keyboard map, recently viewed, all states, mobile sheet), then slice 3 (`/search` results screen
  with facets/selection/export, `/settings/search`).

## 2026-09-26 — REQ-002 · Global search (slice 2: the ⌘K palette and the results screen)

- The panel has its one box. `⌘K`/`Ctrl+K` opens a palette from any screen, `/` focuses the header
  box without opening anything, typing two characters hands over to the palette. Sections are one
  per provider, ordered by how much each provider matched, five rows each plus "see all"; `↑`/`↓`
  walk the whole list across section boundaries, `Tab` jumps sections, `Enter` opens the
  highlighted row, `⌘Enter` opens it in a new tab, `Esc` closes. The empty query shows the
  account's recent searches (removable one by one, clearable completely) and this browser's
  recently viewed screens; a phone gets the same palette as a full-screen sheet with 44px rows.
  `apps/admin/components/search-palette.tsx` + `global-search.tsx` carry it, `lib/search-palette.ts`
  and `lib/search-memory.ts` the logic and the browser's own memory.
- Hits open the thing they name. The indexer writes deep links now (`/pages?site=…&focus=…`,
  `/media?site=…&focus=…`), the palette switches the panel's site before it navigates, the pages
  screen opens the focused page's editor and the library marks the focused file's row. "See all
  results" lands on `/search`, which ships as the honest half of the results screen (query, sort,
  per-provider counts, rows with the match emphasised, pagination, all three states); facets,
  selection, export and `/settings/search` stay in slice 3.
- Slice 1 promised sections for pages, media, sites and accounts but only content emitted events —
  the index carried plans for the others and no producers, so those sections would have stayed
  empty forever. That half shipped too: `media.created`/`media.deleted`, `site.created`/
  `site.updated` and `user.created` are emitted by the routes that change those rows.
- Proof: `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D
  warnings` clean · `cargo test --workspace` → **422 passed, 0 failed (44 suites)**, including the
  new `an_upload_and_a_new_site_reach_the_index_through_the_bus` (three real routes → one indexer
  tick → indexed, then removed) · `pnpm typecheck && pnpm build` → 2/2 · `bash scripts/qa/run.sh`
  → 58 clicks, 67 screenshots, **0 high findings** (`qa-artifacts/20260926-150923`); the pass's
  palette phase reports open (`focusedInput: true`), two sections for "sample" (Media 1, Pages 1),
  the highlight moving `hit-0-0 → hit-1-0`, the row opening `/pages?site=…&focus=…`, the recents
  surviving a reload, and `close` ✓, while the phone sheet measures 390×844 with 44px rows ·
  `scripts/qa/probe-palette.cjs` → **22/22 PASS** (keyboard map incl. `Ctrl+Enter` in a new tab,
  the no-hits state, recents, the box click, `/`, both console-error checks).
- The QA harness grew teeth and immediately used them. The mobile context is signed in now (every
  "mobile" route had been photographing the sign-in screen — a gap, not a screen), the media
  screen's hidden upload input is set directly (a click-through cannot reach a 0×0 control, so the
  library — and everything indexed from it — stayed empty), and an open palette is closed before
  the next round clicks. Real mobile screens then showed a pages table that overflowed a phone and
  a corrupt 82-byte "PNG" fixture that rendered as a broken thumbnail; both fixed here (narrow
  columns and action labels leave before the table does; the fixture is a real 160×120 PNG).
  Overlay screenshots are viewport-only now — a full-page shot of a fixed sheet shows the page
  below the fold and reads as an overlay that fails to cover the screen.
- Carried forward, not caused by this slice: the public renderer answers `404` for its own icon
  requests on every pass (5 medium findings, unchanged since `20260926-134405`), and the vision
  review's one remaining low note guesses the contrast of `text-muted` at ~2.5:1 where the
  harness's own measured check reports zero low-contrast nodes — the token stays as it is.
- Next: **REQ-002 slice 3** — `/search` facets with counts, removable chips, Shift-range + `⌘A`
  selection, Copy links, CSV export (`/search/export`), `/settings/search` (per-provider status,
  ranking weights, reindex progress) and the settings/logs/translations providers; then wave 1
  continues with REQ-032 (command centre).

## 2026-09-26 — REQ-002 slice 3: results depth, the wider provider set, the index's own screen (done)

- The results screen is now the depth the brief asked for. Facets: **Type, Site, Owner, Language,
  Status and Updated**, each with counts and each counted **without its own filter** (so "Pages 12"
  is the number clicking it would leave); applied filters become removable chips; 50 rows a page;
  selection with Shift-range and `⌘A`; Copy links (newline-separated, absolute); CSV export
  (`/search/export`) of the whole result set or of the selection, with the row count in a header;
  the keyboard map (`s` sort, `f` facets, `x` a row, `⌘A` the page, `?` the list); and on phones
  the filters move into a sheet behind `Filters (n)` while the selection bar stays sticky.
- `/settings/search` is new — the index's own screen, reachable from the nav. One row (or card,
  below `md`) per provider: documents, last indexed, **state** (`ready`, `indexing`, `stale`,
  `failed`, `empty`) and the last pass's own numbers, with a Reindex button per provider and for the
  whole index; the ranking weights form (whole numbers, title ≥ body) with the API's validation,
  Restore defaults from the server's own defaults, and a progress line fed by the passes. The
  states are read from `search_reindex_runs` (migration 0013): every pass records what it wrote, how
  long it took and why it failed, so a state is never guessed from a document count.
- Three providers joined the registry, each with a real destination: **Activity** (audit entries
  and recorded events whose target is a page, a file or a site — a row opens the thing it touched),
  **Translations** (a translated field opens its page's editor) and **Settings** (the search
  weights row, one per organization, opening `/settings/search`). The palette renders all three; the
  results screen can filter, select and export them like any other row.
- Proof: `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D
  warnings` clean · `cargo test --workspace` → **436 passed, 0 failed** (five new walks in
  `apps/api/tests/search.rs`: facets leave their own filter out of their own counts, the export
  answers one row per hit and honours `selected=`, the weights flip a fixture's order, the settings
  read/write/refusals, and Activity + Settings are findable with their own screens) · `pnpm
  typecheck && pnpm build` → 2/2 (`/settings/search` in the route table) · `bash scripts/qa/run.sh`
  → 105 clicks, 107 screenshots, **0 high findings**, **0 vision issues**
  (`qa-artifacts/20260926-160500`). The pass's depth phase: 6 facet groups, a type facet narrowed
  13 → 9 hits with one chip, removing it left 0 chips, `s` moved the sort to `newest`, a Shift-range
  selected 3 of 13 rows, Copy links wrote exactly 3 URLs, the exported CSV carried 3 rows (same
  count), the settings screen showed 7 providers with their states, a per-provider reindex answered
  "Indexed 1 document in 15 ms." and its row read `1 written · 0 pruned · 15 ms`.
- The QA harness keeps earning its keep. It caught a real defect in this slice — the settings table
  is a six-column table and a phone reported 7 elements outside the viewport — so the provider rows
  render as cards below `md`, the timestamps no longer wrap, and the disabled Save button stopped
  fading its labelled text (white on pale peach). It also grew a depth phase of its own (facets →
  chips → sort → selection → clipboard → CSV file → shortcuts → reindex → weights), which is what
  makes each of those acceptance claims a number instead of an impression. Two layouts over one
  dataset also taught the harness a selector lesson: `:visible` only, or a click lands on the copy
  that a phone would show.
- Carried forward, not caused by this slice: the public renderer still answers `404` for its own
  icon requests (5 medium findings, unchanged), and the previous pass's single low vision note (the
  overview's `Connect a domain` row) turned out to be a misread — the API and the DOM both report
  the step done, and the re-run reported 0 issues across all 14 screens.
- Next: wave 1 continues with **REQ-032** (command centre: palette + quick actions + recents), then
  REQ-007 (analytics + real dashboard).

## 2026-09-26 — REQ-032 · slice 1 · the palette becomes a command centre

- **Commands are code, not configuration.** `crates/search/src/commands.rs` is the registry (8
  entries today: the panel's screens plus "Create a page"), each naming the permission whose
  holder may run it, the route it opens, keywords, aliases and the screens it is worth suggesting
  on. `visible()` projects it through a caller's effective permissions and `suggest()` picks a
  screen's suggestions — both pure, both unit-tested without a database.
- **The API serves the projection.** `GET /api/v1/commands`, `GET /api/v1/command-center/context`
  and `GET`/`POST`/`DELETE /api/v1/command-center/recent`, all behind `search.read`; migration
  `0014_command_center.sql` adds `command_recents` (per user, trimmed to 50, upserted on repeat)
  and `command_usage_daily`. The palette grew the command group, the `>` `@` `#` `:` `?` prefix
  model with a mode chip, its own Recent list with a Clear control, and focus restoration on `Esc`;
  `/pages?new=1` opens the create form with the cursor already in the title field.
- **Proof:** `cargo fmt`/`clippy` clean · `cargo test --workspace` → **452 passed, 0 failed**
  (9 new walks in `apps/api/tests/command_center.rs`: the projection leaves a member's answer
  without the words "Create a page"/"Open pages", suggestions follow the screen and skip the one
  already open, recents are personal and repeat-safe, the history trims at 50, refusals carry a
  code, an out-of-reach command is dropped on read, every registry id stores) · `pnpm typecheck &&
  pnpm build` → 2/2 · `bash scripts/qa/run.sh` → 105 clicks, 113 screenshots, **0 high findings**,
  **0 vision issues** (`qa-artifacts/20260926-171549`) · `scripts/qa/probe-command-center.cjs` →
  **26/26** (a command lands on its screen and closes the palette, the run is in the account's own
  history when read back through the API, clearing empties it immediately and after a reload, `#qa`
  answers Sites-only, `Tab` walks the groups, no 5xx) · `scripts/qa/probe-palette.cjs` → **22/22**
  (the REQ-002 palette regressions: arrows, `Ctrl+Enter` new tab, no-results, the phone sheet, and
  the query remembered under the renamed Recent group).
- **The pass caught two defects.** (1) The palette opens over the results screen's dialog and the
  scrim closes it without touching the dialog (palette `z 50` over `z 40`), but the harness step
  first clicked the scrim's *centre* — where the dialog sits — and read the interception as a
  failure; it clicks the corner now. (2) A real one: the migration's id-format check rejected
  hyphens, so recording `nav.create-page` answered `500` — invisible to the integration suite
  (which only recorded `nav.pages`/`nav.media`) until the browser probe fired a real one.
  `every_registered_command_can_be_remembered` now walks the whole registry through the endpoint.
- The walkthrough also flagged the pages table pushing its Actions column 21px past a phone's edge,
  so the page cell is now the flexible one (`w-full max-w-0`) — the vision review reports 0 issues.
- Carried forward, not caused by this slice: the public renderer still answers `404` for its own
  icon requests (5 medium findings, unchanged).
- Next: wave 1 continues with **REQ-032 slice 2** (federated search in the palette: per-group
  loading and errors, type filters, the URL-backed `/search`), then REQ-007 (analytics + real
  dashboard).

## 2026-09-26 — REQ-032 · slice 2 · the palette answers in groups

- **Each provider answers on its own.** The palette stopped slicing one answer: it asks every
  provider its own question (`/api/v1/search?q=…&types=pages`) in waves of three, so a section has
  its own skeleton while its request is in flight, its own rows when it answers, and its own
  retryable error — the failure's code and status in the tooltip — when it fails. One slow or
  failing type never blanks the rest. A whole-index count rides behind the first wave for the "see
  all results" total; sections keep the registry's order instead of reshuffling under the reader's
  eyes as answers land.
- **Typing is not a search worth remembering.** The endpoint grew `history=false`; the palette's
  federated calls say it, so `search_recent` stays the record of searches someone committed to
  (a hit opened, a section's "see all", the results screen). The palette's own history is
  `command_recents`, written on commit. Nine parallel calls per keystroke pause also became three
  at a time **because the walkthrough proved it**: with nine in flight the page's own RSC
  prefetches queued behind them and two navigations were recorded as `net::ERR_ABORTED` (high) —
  the cap removed both, `GROUP_CONCURRENCY` in the palette.
- **An empty answer now says which empty it is.** `hidden_total` (a count, never a title, computed
  over the enabled providers the caller's keys do not cover, and only when their own answer is
  empty) lets the results screen and the palette tell "nothing matched" from "nothing you may read
  matched": "N results are outside your permissions." The palette's no-results state also offers
  the way out as real rows — `/search?q=…` and `/ai?q=…` (the AI Hub opens with the words in its
  prompt; nothing is asked on the reader's behalf).
- **A "see all" is a link the screen understands.** `sectionUrl` emits the results screen's own
  `type=<provider>` parameter, so the link lands with its chip applied, its rail already knowing
  which type is on, and the search box still showing the words that were typed.
- **The narrowing is a property of the requests now.** `>` asks the registry and never the index
  (0 calls, 0 sections); `@`/`#`/`:` ask exactly one provider each. A regression of mine —
  `>` + text listed the whole command list instead of the matches, so Enter landed on "Search
  everything" — was caught by the *walkthrough*, not by the new probe: the end-to-end click pass
  is the reason the palette's own commands still work.
- **Proof:** `cargo test --workspace` → **455 passed, 0 failed** (3 new: the count outside a
  reader's scope at the API — counted, titled nowhere, `0` for the reader who sees everything —
  plus the `history=false` walk and its wire test) · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D
  warnings` clean · `pnpm typecheck && pnpm build` 2/2 · `bash scripts/qa/run.sh` → 77 clicks, 98
  screenshots, **0 high findings**, **0 vision issues** (`qa-artifacts/20260926-180233`) ·
  `scripts/qa/probe-palette-federated.cjs` → **32/32** (delayed provider → own skeleton while
  another holds rows; 503 on one type → that section retryable, the rest rendering; `>`/`#`/`:`/`@`
  ask what they say; `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` walk sections; "see all" → `/search?q=…&type=pages` with the
  API's own count, same after a reload; "zzqqxx" → the results screen + a prefilled AI Hub;
  history clean; as the Member: no "Create a page"/"Open sites", the shared sites link renders 0
  rows and "1 result is outside your permissions." with no title in the answer) ·
  `probe-command-center.cjs` **26/26** and `probe-palette.cjs` **22/22** re-run clean (no slice-1
  regressions) · the typing budget, keystroke → row over 20 samples: **p50 197 ms · p95 220 ms ·
  max 237 ms** (criterion: 300 ms p95).
- **Found, not fixed (REQ-002's ground):** creating a draft page emits no event, so a fresh draft
  reaches the index only on a publish or a reindex — the indexer's plan lists `page.created`
  (`crates/search/src/indexer.rs`) but `POST /api/v1/pages` never emits it. The probe works around
  it with an explicit reindex; the gap is worth a REQ-002 follow-up rather than a quiet fix here.
- Carried forward, not caused by this slice: the public renderer still answers `404` for its own
  icon requests (5 medium findings, unchanged).
- Next: REQ-032 stayed in progress — **slice 3** was the next tick's work.

## 2026-09-26 — REQ-032 · slice 3 · the palette acts, and says so

- **A command has a kind.** The registry grew `CommandKind::Action` and a `confirm` flag, and
  `runnable()` answers only for actions — so the API's `not_runnable` refusal cannot drift from what
  the projection says. Two actions ship with the services that exist today: rebuilding the whole
  search index (`search.manage`, asks first) and clearing the account's own palette history (asks
  first; no key beyond being signed in). The four examples in the request — "Create customer",
  "Create workflow", "Run backup", "Switch site" — arrive with their owning services (CRM, the
  workflows screen, a backup service, a palette parameter model), none of which exist yet; the
  pattern for each is now one registry entry + one match arm + one audit expectation.
- **The act is the owning service's code, not a copy.** `search::perform_reindex` (its audit row and
  `search.reindexed` event included) now serves both the settings screen's button and the palette's
  command, and one `clear_recents` serves the palette's Clear control and the `act.clear-recents`
  command — two entry points, one behaviour, no drift possible.
- **The confirmation is a platform rule.** `POST /commands/{id}/run` carries no route-level guard
  on purpose: every command has its own key, so the handler re-checks it, refuses a navigation
  command by name, refuses an unknown id as a 404, and refuses an unconfirmed run with
  `confirmation_required` **before anything executes** — a programmatic caller that skips the card
  still has to say yes. The audit trail is provably unchanged while the palette's question is open
  (the probe reads it before, during and after).
- **One entry and one count per executed command.** `command.run` names actor, command (as the
  target), outcome and the owning service's aggregate result — never a row of content — and
  `command_usage_daily` counts the run (upserted by user/command/day, no query text). A refused run
  writes nothing at all; the probe asserts the trail is unchanged after all three refusals.
- **The palette never invents the outcome.** The result card prints the run endpoint's own message
  ("Rebuilt 7 providers · 18 documents · 95 ms") and links to the screen that reads the record back
  (`/settings/search`, which shows the same pass as the provider's last run). Recents of an action
  command run it again instead of navigating.
- **A defect found and fixed in this tick, not caused by this slice:** the search suite asserted
  that one `indexer::drain(_, 100)` applies its own event; with action-command reindexes on the same
  shared bus (every reindex leaves one `search.reindexed` per provider, and those are skipped rather
  than applied) a single batch can be spent on history the suite does not own. The suite now ticks
  the way the runner does — bounded batches until one applies something.
- **Proof:** `cargo test --workspace` → **463 passed, 0 failed** (8 new walks: 3 registry + 5
  command-centre) · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` → clean · `pnpm
  typecheck && pnpm build` → 2/2 · `bash scripts/qa/run.sh` → 105 clicks, 115 screenshots, **0 high
  findings**, **0 vision issues** (`qa-artifacts/20260926-184340`; 5 medium = the public renderer's
  own icon 404s, carried forward) · `scripts/qa/probe-command-actions.cjs` → **31/31** ·
  `probe-command-center.cjs` **26/26** · `probe-palette.cjs` **22/22** ·
  `probe-palette-federated.cjs` **32/32** · the walkthrough's own steps record
  `ranNothingYet: true` (nothing ran while the question was open) and `newEntries: 1` with
  `target: act.reindex-search`, `outcome: ok`.
- Carried forward, not caused by this slice: the public renderer still answers `404` for its own
  icon requests (5 medium findings, unchanged). Slice 2's finding stands: creating a draft page emits
  no event, so a fresh draft reaches the index only on a publish or a reindex.
- Next: REQ-032 stays in progress — **slice 4** (natural-language resolution: `POST
  /command-center/resolve` on ai-hub, the intent preview card, confidence threshold with "Did you
  mean", `Edit as search`, timeout fallback); wave 1 then moves to REQ-007 (analytics + the real
  dashboard).

## 2026-09-26 — REQ-032 · slice 4 · the palette reads what is typed into it

- **A phrase becomes a structure, checked against the platform's own tables.** `crates/search/src/intent.rs`
  reads one phrase into the vocabulary the platform really has — the domain maps through the provider
  registry, a command is only ever a registry entry whose own words the phrase covered, filters are the
  ones the index supports, and confidence is *computed* from what was recognised, so the same words
  always read the same way. An unmapped domain stays a search and says so; a command the caller cannot
  run is dropped and the words search instead. 13 walks, no database.
- **The model is asked first and checked afterwards.** `POST /api/v1/command-center/resolve` (guard
  `search.read`) answers the intent, a preview line, `runnable`, the destinations, the alternatives and
  where the reading came from — and executes nothing. A connected model gets a six-second bound and a
  closed vocabulary; its answer is *normalised* (unknown command, unknown provider, out-of-range sort or
  count dropped, not trusted) and an unusable one leaves the grammar's reading standing with
  `degraded: true`. Only model readings are audited (`command.resolve`: the interpreted intent, never a
  row of content). The endpoint answers `search_route` (the editable search) beside `route` (where a
  runnable reading lands), because a reading the caller may not run still has an editable shape.
- **The card is a proposal beside the results, not a gate in front of them.** It sits above the list
  like the confirmation card and is deliberately not an arrow-key row (every row the arrows reach must
  be a screen); its controls are real buttons, ≥44px on touch. `Run` shows only for a runnable reading,
  and a reading of an action command opens the platform's *own* confirmation card, so a command that
  asks first asks here too. `Edit as search` always exists, the request aborts when a newer keystroke
  overtakes it, and a failing reader offers a retry. Low confidence ("zzqqxx", 55%) carries no Run at
  all — only alternatives.
- Proof: `cargo test --workspace` → **490 passed, 0 failed** (27 new) · `cargo clippy --workspace
  --all-targets -- -D warnings` → clean · `pnpm typecheck && pnpm build` → 2/2 · `bash scripts/qa/run.sh`
  → 97 clicks, 117 screenshots, **0 high findings**, **0 vision issues** (`qa-artifacts/20260926-194131`;
  the walkthrough's new steps record `parsedIntent: true · offersRun: false · ranNothingYet: true` and
  `Edit as search` landing on `/search?q=tickets+Mehmet&sort=newest`) · `scripts/qa/probe-command-resolve.cjs`
  → **47/47** (including a connected model that never answers degrading in **6.4 s** with its audit entry,
  and the card at 390×844) · the four older palette probes re-run clean.
- Next: **wave 1 moves to REQ-007** (analytics + the real dashboard). REQ-032 is closed; carried
  forward, not caused by this slice: the public renderer's own icon 404s (5 medium findings), and
  `page.created` is still not emitted by `POST /api/v1/pages` (REQ-002 follow-up).

## 2026-09-26 — REQ-007 · slice 1 · the platform starts counting

- **One beacon becomes rows, and the decision comes first.** `POST /api/v1/public/analytics/collect`
  is a public write path, so what protects it is what a public write path *can* be protected by:
  a 64 KB body cap, a per-site-and-caller budget (429 named `rate_limited`, tested by spending the
  whole budget), a site resolved exactly as the renderer resolves it (`?site=`, then the
  forwarded host, then the installation's only site) — and a collector that decides **before** it
  writes. Tracking switched off, `DNT: 1`, `Sec-GPC: 1`, a crawler user agent, an excluded path or
  address and the site's own sample rate are all evaluated ahead of the first write, which is why a
  dropped beacon leaves no trace at all: not a visit, not an event, not even the day's salt row.
  What it does leave is a counter — the day's `filtered` bucket, the one metric the rollup is
  forbidden to recompute (the bucket delete is narrowed with `metric = any(...)`).
- **A hash instead of a person.** The visitor identifier is `sha256(site, day-salt, address, user
  agent)`; the salt is 32 random bytes per UTC day in `analytics_salts` and nothing else is stored.
  The tests read the row and find a 64-hex hash and `ip_prefix = null`. With `anonymize_ip` switched
  off the row keeps the truncated network only — `203.0.113.0/24`, `2001:db8:1::/48` — the widths
  the request documents, asserted in the walk and in the module's own unit tests.
- **A bucket run is a delete and a rewrite, not an increment.** `rollup_day`/`rollup_hour` recompute
  every metric/dimension pair from the raw rows inside one transaction, so running a bucket twice
  writes the same numbers: the walk snapshots `analytics_daily` before and after the second run and
  compares them row for row. High-cardinality dimensions are capped at fifty values per bucket with
  the tail folded into `(other)`, sorted by count and then by value so two runs write the same order.
- **The settings screen's validation is the API's validation.** One `validate()` in the module is
  what both the endpoint and (from slice 2) the panel call; `retention_days = 3` answers
  `invalid_analytics_settings` and the message *names the field*, `mode` is closed to the two
  documented values, and excluded paths and addresses are checked line by line. Reading a site's
  settings and snippet is `analytics.read`; changing them is `analytics.settings.manage`; both
  resolve the site through the caller's own organization — a reader of the second organization gets
  `cross_organization`, and the platform Owner is the caller who may reach across.
- **`modules/` exists now.** REQ-007 called for `modules/analytics` while every previous feature
  landed under `crates/`; docs/04-MONOREPO.md reserves `modules/` for features a customer can carry,
  so the workspace gained `modules/*` and this is its first member (`omnion-module-analytics`).
  The schema landed as **0015** — 0012–0014 went to search and the command centre while this request
  waited, and the "next free slot at build time" rule in the request is what that means.
- **Two deliberate reads of the same promise.** The tracker (`apps/web/public/analytics.js`) stops
  before it makes a request when the browser reports DNT or GPC, and the collector enforces the same
  rules again on the server: a client-side promise is not a promise. Engagement rides as a
  `page_engagement` **event** rather than a second pageview beacon, because a second pageview for the
  same page would double-count it.
- **Proof:** `cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast` → **524 passed, 0 failed** (analytics: 22 module
  units + 6 integration walks; every other suite unchanged and green) · `cargo clippy --workspace
  --all-targets -- -D warnings` → clean · `pnpm typecheck && pnpm build` → 2/2 · `bash
  scripts/qa/run.sh` → 105 clicks, 117 screenshots, **0 high findings**, **0 vision issues**
  (`qa-artifacts/20260926-202816`; the 5 medium findings are the public renderer's own icon 404s,
  carried forward). This slice ships no screen, so the walkthrough inventory is unchanged.
- **Fresh-database proof:** `create database omnion_fresh_check` + `omnion migrate` →
  `applying 14 pending migration(s): 1 … 15` → `database is up to date (14 of 14 migrations
  applied)`, and the database holds 11 `analytics_*` tables with zero settings rows (an empty
  installation has no sites to seed for). The check database was dropped afterwards.
- Carried forward, not caused by this slice: the public renderer's icon 404s (5 medium), and
  `page.created` is still not emitted by `POST /api/v1/pages` (REQ-002 follow-up).
- Next: REQ-007 stays in progress — **slice 2** (overview + the six report screens over these
  rollups, the shared date-range toolbar, filters, drawers and CSV export, plus the walkthrough
  gaining the ten `/analytics` routes with a synthetic beacon batch).
