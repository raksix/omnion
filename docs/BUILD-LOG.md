## 2026-09-28 — REQ-125 slice 3 close · three defects a green test suite could not see

- **What shipped.** `e4e97c7` — the repairs the slice-3 walkthrough found, committed after the
  interrupted tick left them in the working tree. **`apps/api/src/routes/secrets_leases.rs`**:
  `CreateDeploymentKeyInput::expires_at` grows `#[serde(with = "time::serde::rfc3339")]`, and two
  unit tests pin the wire format in both directions. **`apps/api/src/routes/secrets.rs`**:
  `SecretsError::ReadOnly` maps to `422` rather than `400`. **`crates/secrets/src/leases.rs`**:
  `issue_lease` names every column of `LeaseRow` in its `returning` clause, with `name` and
  `version` from a lateral join instead of a second round trip. **`apps/api/tests/`**: the
  read-only walk (a `422` for a typed write *and* for a lease, the row listed and explained), and
  two error-shape corrections. **`scripts/qa/walkthrough.cjs`**: the Chromium memory flags.
- **Proof.** `cargo test -p omnion-secrets --lib` → **41 tests, 0 failures**. `cargo test -p
  omnion-api --lib` → **106 tests, 0 failures**. `cargo test -p omnion-api --test secret_leases`
  → **1 walk, 0 failures** and `--test secret_credentials` → **1 walk, 0 failures**, each against
  its own fresh database (`omnion_w6_iter3`, `omnion_w6_cred`) rather than the shared dev
  database, which refuses `db.migrate()` with `VersionMissing(19)`. `pnpm typecheck` → clean.
  Browser pass: all five secrets screens — `/secrets/root-key`, `/secrets/credentials`,
  `/secrets/slots`, `/secrets/leases`, `/secrets/deploy-keys` — visited and clicked, each with
  its per-control screenshots and one console-error capture.
- **The defect that matters most is the one the type system never sees.** The panel sends
  `new Date(...).toISOString()`; `time::OffsetDateTime` deserialized from a *tuple*. So the single
  required field of the create body was the single field the API could not read, and the create
  drawer was a dead button for every operator. Cargo was green, `pnpm typecheck` was green, and
  every test was green, because the tests asserted the shape the code produced. **A unit test on
  a DTO must post the exact bytes the browser sends** — the round trip is the only thing that
  notices a mismatch between what a client writes and what a server reads.
- **`400` versus `422` is a contract, not a preference.** A read-only `file`/`env` bridge is a
  well-formed request against a resource that will never accept the write, because the credential
  is managed outside the platform. `400` invites a retry with different input, and no input would
  help. The acceptance line already asked for `405`/`422`; the code answered `400` and the test
  agreed with the code.
- **A migration number is global, not per-branch, and sqlx keys on version *and* checksum.**
  `0026` was already open in wave 7, so two files claiming it would make every database that
  applied one refuse the other. Renumbered to `0027` from an `ls` of the sibling worktrees, not
  from a counter that pretends the branch is alone.
- **A partial index predicate may not call `now()`** — `42P17 functions in index predicate must be
  marked IMMUTABLE`, because `STABLE` functions depend on the statement's timestamp rather than
  its arguments. The index that migration wanted also already existed in `0019` under another
  name, so the file kept neither.
- **`Page crashed` is a memory signal, not a page defect.** Five writers' Chromiums on one 32 GB
  box leave zero free, and the renderer is the process that dies — on a random screen, with a
  message that reads exactly like a broken one. The launch args now cap the JS heap at 512 MB
  and disable the GPU. A crashed walkthrough reports `summary.fatal` and writes no `pages`; the
  screenshots already on disk are the tell.
- **Next.** Slice 4 — audit depth, denial rows everywhere, the anomaly detectors with a
  persisting acknowledge, and the filtered SIEM export that carries metadata only.

## 2026-09-28 — REQ-006 slice 4b-2 · a live provider, and the four defects only a live provider shows

- **What shipped.** **`87390ff`** — `apps/api/tests/support/stub_idp.rs`, a real identity provider
  this process starts on a loopback port: a discovery document, a JWKS, an authorization endpoint
  that answers `302` with a `Location`, a token endpoint that verifies the PKCE challenge itself and
  spends a code exactly once, and a SAML endpoint that signs an assertion with both halves of the
  XML-signature binding — all under one freshly generated 2048-bit RSA key.
  `apps/api/tests/sso_live.rs` drives the **real router** against it: the browser is sent to the
  provider's own endpoint, comes back with a code, the code is exchanged, the token is verified
  against the *published* keys, the claim → role mapping attaches the role, JIT provisions the
  account, and `GET /me` with the resulting cookie names the directory person. The same file does
  SAML. Plus the fixes below.
- **Why a stub and not more fixtures.** Every other proof of enterprise sign-in tested one layer:
  a verifier against a synthetic token, a reader against a hand-built assertion, the HTTP layer
  against refusals it triggers itself. None of them proved that a *browser* can complete a round
  trip, because that needs a provider on the other end. The stub shares nothing with the code it
  tests except the `rsa` crate, so agreement between the two sides is evidence rather than
  tautology.
- **Proof.** `cargo test --workspace --lib` → **598 unit tests, 0 failures**. `cargo test -p
  omnion-api --test sso --test sso_live` → **3 walks, 0 failures**, all three in one database.
  `pnpm typecheck` green. `cargo clippy --all-targets` adds no new warning.
- **Four defects the walk found, and each is a thing no layer-by-layer test could see.**
  **(1) Every SAML sign-in was broken.** The relay page posted the *return path* as `RelayState`
  while the callback claims a **challenge** from `RelayState` — so the callback could never claim
  one and every SAML sign-in ended in `invalid_state`. The page now carries the challenge `start`
  issued (and HTML-escapes it, because the route is public and a `state` query is attacker-supplied
  in the general case). **(2) `c_hash` was checked against the PKCE verifier's hash.** No provider
  has ever seen the verifier, so a real directory could not satisfy that rule: it refused every
  legitimate sign-in while proving nothing. It is now the real code hash (OIDC Core §3.1.3.6), and
  a *missing* `c_hash` is not a refusal, because the claim is a RECOMMENDED and an optional claim
  cannot be a mandatory rule. **(3) The SAML `test` button could never report success.** Its probe
  was a self-closing `<saml:Assertion/>` that the reader never parses, and the verdict was
  inferred from the error text — so every certificate read as broken. The certificate step is now
  exposed on its own and the claim half is probed with a document the real reader accepts, which
  also catches a typo in an attribute name before the first real assertion. **(4) The claim → role
  mapping silently did nothing for every tenant.** It looked the role up with the tenant's
  organization id, but the base roles are seeded at *platform* scope, so `editors` → `editor`
  matched nothing and the person signed in with no role and no error — the worst possible outcome
  for the feature whose whole point is the mapping. The lookup now falls back to the platform role,
  the way the rest of the platform finds one.
- **A test that only passes in one harness is a test that lies.** The walk's first version swept
  `email like 'sso-live-%'` to clear leftovers from a crashed run. It passed in CI (one database
  per job) and failed against a shared one, because it deleted a sibling suite's fixtures
  mid-run. Every statement is now scoped to the walk's own organizations, and all three walks are
  proven to pass together in one database.
- **Owner action, still open: the disk.** `/mnt/apopic` (one 60 GB loop image shared by eight
  worktrees' `target/`) hit **0 bytes free** twice during this tick and a link failed with
  `No space left on device`. `target/debug/incremental` was cleared twice, and the **unclaimed**
  `omnion-w4`/`w5`/`w7` worktree `target/` directories (12.6 GB of build artifacts, no wave owns
  them, no `cargo` running) were removed. That returned 13 GB. **The unclaimed worktrees should be
  pruned outright, or the box needs more room** — a link failure is a red build, and one will
  happen again mid-tick.
- **Owner action, still open: the shared dev database.** `omnion` has migration **19** applied from
  a sibling branch that `main` does not have, so `db.migrate()` refuses with `VersionMissing(19)`
  and every integration test that migrates fails there. CI is clean. This tick ran against a
  dedicated `omnion_sso_live` database instead, which is the right shape for a local run and worth
  making the default until the 0019 slot is reconciled.
- **Next.** REQ-006 is **done** — every slice shipped and every acceptance box ticked. The next
  REQ in wave 1 order is **REQ-010** (the enterprise file manager). This tick is not a close tick
  in the QA-pass sense (no screen changed), so `scripts/qa/run.sh` was not run; the next tick that
  lands a screen carries it.
# Omnion — Build Log

> Cross-tick memory for the **`omnion-build`** loop. Newest entries at the bottom. 3-5 lines
> per entry: phase · what got done · proof (command + result) · next.

## 2026-09-25 — Loop bootstrap (chat session)

- Build phase opened by owner directive: Lokma-style loop, start building; code first, deploy later (dev target: omnion.fermag.com.tr).
- Created: `docs/BUILD-BACKLOG.md` (P00→P14 + gated P-DEP) + this log + `omnion-build` cron loop (pinned model).
- Toolchain status: node 22 ✓ · pnpm 11 ✓ · bun ✓ · docker 29 ✓ · gcc 13 ✓ · **Rust NOT installed → P00 installs rustup**.
- Next: **P00 — Toolchain + repo skeleton.**

## 2026-09-25 — P00 · Toolchain + repo skeleton

- Rust toolchain installed via rustup (minimal, stable): `cargo 1.98.1` · `rustc 1.98.1`.
- Workspace: root `Cargo.toml` (resolver 2, members `apps/api` + `crates/*`) + `rust-toolchain.toml` (stable, rustfmt + clippy).
- `apps/api` (thin HTTP layer, docs/04): `src/lib.rs`, `main.rs`, `state.rs`, `routes/{mod,health}.rs` —
  `GET /healthz` → `{"ok":true,"service":"omnion-api","version":"0.1.0"}`, `PORT` env (default 8080, invalid value fails fast);
  `crates/core`: `omnion-core` infrastructure lib exposing `BuildInfo`, consumed by the API state.
- Infra: `infra/compose/docker-compose.dev.yml` (+ `postgres.yml`, `redis.yml`, `minio.yml`, `mailpit.yml`) with overridable
  host ports; `.gitignore` gains `target/`; CI skeleton `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (fmt · clippy `-D warnings` · test + compose config check).
- Proof: `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` → Finished ✅ · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` → clean ✅ ·
  `cargo test --workspace` → 2 passed (router `/healthz` integration test + core metadata) ✅ ·
  `curl -i 127.0.0.1:8080/healthz` → `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` body `{"ok":true,"service":"omnion-api","version":"0.1.0"}` ✅ ·
  `PORT=18080` → 200 ✅ · `docker compose -f infra/compose/docker-compose.dev.yml config --quiet` → valid, services
  `postgres, redis, minio, mailpit` ✅.
- CI on GitHub: workflow run `36193827205` → **success** (jobs: `Rust — fmt · clippy · test` ✅ · `Infra — compose config` ✅).
- Repo note: this clone's `origin` moved to the SSH URL — the stored OAuth token has no `workflow` scope, so over HTTPS GitHub rejects any commit touching `.github/workflows/`.
- Next: **P01 — Core foundations** (typed env config + tracing subscriber + shared error type, sqlx/Postgres pool + `database/migrations/0001_initial.sql`, `GET /readyz` with DB + Redis pings).

## 2026-09-25 — P01 · Core foundations

- `crates/core` gained the shared infrastructure layer: typed `config` (OMNION_* keys, `PORT` fallback,
  validation for environment/port/pool size/URL schemes, pretty-vs-JSON log defaults), `telemetry`
  (tracing subscriber with the OpenTelemetry layer hook plus a shutdown handle), `error`
  (`ConfigError` + `CoreError`), `db` (SQLx pool + embedded migration runner) and `redis_client`
  (lazily connected handle that reconnects without a restart).
- `database/migrations/0001_initial.sql`: organizations, users (case-insensitive unique email),
  sessions (hashed tokens only) and an append-only `audit_log` whose `actor_type` also covers the
  AI Hub audit chain.
- `apps/api` boots config → telemetry → database + migrations → redis → HTTP, with SIGTERM/Ctrl-C
  graceful shutdown. `GET /readyz` pings both dependencies — `200` only when everything answers,
  `503` with detail in development — and `ApiError` maps core errors onto the HTTP surface (`503`
  for an unavailable dependency, `500` otherwise).
- Proof: `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
  clean · `cargo test --workspace` → **27 passed** (20 core unit · 3 api unit · 1 healthz ·
  3 readyz integration against the live compose stack) · live run: `GET /healthz` → `200
  {"ok":true,…}` and `GET /readyz` → `200 {"checks":{"database":{"status":"ok"},"redis":{"status":"ok"}}}` ·
  `_sqlx_migrations` shows version 1 "initial" with `success = t`, and `\dt` lists
  organizations · users · sessions · audit_log · failure path: with Redis stopped, `/readyz` → `503
  redis unavailable (broken pipe)` while `/healthz` stayed `200`, and it returned to `200` without
  restarting the API once Redis was back.
- Dev stack: `docker compose -f infra/compose/docker-compose.dev.yml up -d` now really starts all four
  containers (postgres 5433 · redis 6380 · minio 9000/9001 · mailpit 1025/8025). Upstream MinIO images
  are no longer published on Docker Hub (`pull access denied`), so `infra/compose/minio.yml` pulls the
  community mirror `pgsty/minio` — the same server binary.
- CI: the Rust job now provisions PostgreSQL + Redis service containers (so the readiness integration
  tests run for real) and adds a smoke step that boots the API and curls `/healthz` + `/readyz`.
- CI run `36195108450` → **success** (Rust job `1m51s`, Infra job `5s`): the readyz suite passed 3/3
  against the service containers and the smoke step logged `listening address=0.0.0.0:8080`,
  `{"ok":true,…}` for `/healthz`, `{"checks":{"database":{"status":"ok"},"redis":{"status":"ok"}}}` for
  `/readyz`, then `shutdown signal received` after SIGTERM.
- Next: **P02 — Identity v0** (users + argon2, sessions, login/logout, first-admin bootstrap,
  integration tests).

## 2026-09-25 — P02 · Identity v0

- New crate `crates/identity` (docs/07-IAM.md subset): `users` (create/find by email or id,
  lowercase-normalized addresses, case-insensitive uniqueness), `password` (Argon2id hashing on the
  blocking pool, minimum length policy, `dummy_verify` so unknown addresses burn the same work as
  wrong passwords), `sessions` (256-bit hex tokens; only the SHA-256 hash is stored; 30-day TTL;
  resolve/touch/revoke) and `authentication` (`authenticate` returns Authenticated /
  InvalidCredentials / AccountDisabled — account status is only disclosed after the password
  verified).
- `crates/core` config gains `OMNION_ADMIN_EMAIL` + `OMNION_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (both-or-neither
  validation, password redacted from `Debug`); `apps/api` boot now seeds the first administrator on
  an empty database (`bootstrap_first_admin`, idempotent and race-safe) and logs why it skipped
  otherwise.
- API surface: `POST /api/v1/auth/login` (session cookie `omnion_session`, HttpOnly + SameSite=Lax,
  `Secure` outside development, Max-Age 30 days) · `GET /api/v1/me` — backed by a `CurrentSession`
  extractor (401 `unauthenticated` / `invalid_session`) · `POST /api/v1/auth/logout` (204, revokes and
  clears). Identity errors map onto the HTTP surface through `ApiError` (exhausted pool → 503).
  `ClientAddress` extractor captures the peer IP for `sessions.ip_address` without requiring
  connect-info (axum has no optional `ConnectInfo`), and the server is served with
  `into_make_service_with_connect_info`.
- Proof: `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
  clean · `cargo test --workspace` → **65 passed** (identity 18 · core 23 · api unit 14 · health 1 ·
  readyz 3 · auth integration 6 — including bootstrap on a throwaway database and revoke-after-logout)
  · live run on `:18080` against the compose stack: boot log `first administrator account created`,
  `/healthz` 200, `/readyz` 200 both checks ok, login 200 + `set-cookie: omnion_session=…; Path=/;
  HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax; Max-Age=2592000` with a 64-char token, `/me` 200 with the account JSON,
  `/me` without cookie 401 `unauthenticated`, logout 204 + `Max-Age=0`, replayed revoked token 401
  `invalid_session`, wrong password 401 `invalid_credentials`; database check: `admin@omnion.test`
  row with `$argon2id$v=19$…`, one session row with a hash that is not the token, `revoked = t`,
  `seen = t`.
- CI: the smoke step now seeds the admin and walks login → me → anonymous 401 → logout.
- CI run `36196441876` → **success**: `Rust — fmt · clippy · test` ✅ (1m11s — the identity suite ran
  against the service containers) · `Infra — compose config` ✅ (4s).
- Next: **P03 — IAM v0** (roles, permissions, role bindings, `require(permission)` guard, audit
  writes, role seeds from docs/07 §3).

## 2026-09-25 — P03 · IAM v0

- New crate `crates/permissions` (docs/07-IAM.md): the permission catalogue (32 keys across
  content/media/users/plugins/deployment/iam/audit), fully custom roles with priority, an inheritance
  link and flag, explicit allow/deny entries and scoped role bindings (global / organization / site,
  `expires_at` for temporary roles). `evaluate::RoleGraph` is a pure, deterministic resolver for the
  documented precedence — explicit deny > explicit allow > inherited allow > default deny — and it
  reports the provenance of every verdict (the seed of the permission simulator, §18). `crates/audit`
  is the append-only trail writer (§13, §19) reused by later AI-agent actions.
- Migration `0002_iam.sql`: `permissions`, `roles` (platform vs organization roles, key unique per
  scope), `role_permissions` (allow/deny, one row per key) and `role_bindings` (scope shape enforced by
  a check constraint, live combinations unique, `site_id` gains its foreign key with P04).
- `apps/api`: `require(permission)` guard (`src/guards.rs`) wraps routes, resolves the session once and
  hands it to the handler through the request extensions; privileged actions write audit rows in the
  same request. New `/api/v1/iam` surface: permissions, roles (GET/POST), role permissions (PUT),
  bindings (GET/POST), effective-permissions (own set without a permission, others need
  `iam.roles.read`) and audit (GET, `audit.read`). Boot seeds the catalogue and the six base roles
  (§3) and keeps the "at least one Owner" invariant (§20), auditing the fallback binding as a platform
  action.
- Fixed: adding a migration did not rebuild `omnion-core`, so the embedded migrator kept the old set
  and `0002` silently never applied (`relation "permissions" does not exist`). `crates/core/build.rs`
  now emits `cargo:rerun-if-changed=../../database/migrations`.
- Proof: `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
  clean · `cargo test --workspace` → **95 passed** (permissions 20 unit incl. deny/inheritance/cycle
  cases · audit 2 · api unit 17 · identity 18 · iam integration 4 against the compose stack).
- Live run on `:18081` against the compose stack: boot log `permission catalogue and base roles ready
  permissions=32`; `/healthz` 200 and `/readyz` both checks ok; anonymous `/api/v1/me` 401 and
  `/api/v1/iam/roles` 401; a signed-in session without a role gets `403 permission_denied` naming
  `iam.roles.read`; after the platform Owner binding `GET /iam/roles` → 200 with the ladder (`owner
  p1000 allow=32`, `administrator p900 allow=32`, `manager p700 allow=21`, `moderator p500 allow=9`);
  `POST /iam/roles` 201, `PUT /iam/roles/{id}/permissions` 200, `POST /iam/bindings` 201, editing a
  platform role 403 `system_role`; `/api/v1/iam/audit` lists `iam.binding.granted`,
  `iam.role.permissions_updated` and `iam.role.created` with actor, target and metadata, and the same
  rows are in `audit_log`.
- CI: the smoke step now also walks the gated surface (roles + own effective set, anonymous 401 for
  roles/audit). Run `36197985861` → **success**: `Rust — fmt · clippy · test` ✅ (1m06s; the smoke log
  shows `permission catalogue and base roles ready permissions=32`, the six base roles with the
  documented priorities and allow counts 32/32/21/9/8/2, the administrator's global Owner binding and
  the resolved effective set) · `Infra — compose config` ✅.
- Next: **P04 — Tenancy v0** (organizations, sites, domains + CRUD API, scope enforcement,
  cross-tenant denial tests).

## 2026-09-25 — P04 · Tenancy v0

- Migration `0003_tenancy.sql` (docs/01-VISION.md §10, docs/07-IAM.md §7): `sites` (one property
  of one organization, `key` unique per organization) and `site_domains` (host unique
  platform-wide, at most one primary per site through a partial unique index). The site-scoped
  role binding finally gets its foreign key; the narrow pre-constraint cleanup retires bindings
  that pointed at no site, so the constraint applies on an existing database.
- `crates/identity` grows the tenancy store: `organizations` (create/read/list/update/delete with
  slug, name and status validation) and `sites` (site and domain CRUD, host validation, automatic
  first-primary plus promotion on removal, `find_site_by_host` — the routing primitive P07 builds
  on). `IdentityError` learns the tenancy variants; `apps/api/src/error.rs` maps them
  (404 not-found, 409 taken, 400 shape).
- `crates/permissions`: new `tenancy` category — `organizations.read|manage`,
  `sites.read|create|update|delete`, `domains.manage`; the Manager ladder gains site management
  and Moderator/Editor `sites.read`; `bindings::validate` now refuses a site scope that names an
  unknown site or one of another organization.
- `apps/api`: `/api/v1/organizations` (GET/POST/GET id/PATCH/DELETE) and `/api/v1/sites`
  (GET/POST/GET id/PATCH/DELETE) plus `/{id}/domains`, `/{id}/domains/{domain_id}` and
  `/{id}/domains/{domain_id}/primary`, all behind the new guards. The shared `scope.rs` helpers
  carry the tenancy rule — an account with a primary organization stays inside it, opening and
  deleting a tenant is platform-only — and `routes/iam.rs` now uses them instead of its own
  copies. Deleting a tenant requires it to be empty (`409 organization_not_empty`).
- Proof: `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
  clean · `cargo test --workspace` → **119 passed** (identity 27 · permissions 22 · core 23 · api
  unit 26 · auth 6 · health 1 · iam 4 · readyz 3 · tenancy 5 integration against the compose
  stack, incl. cross-tenant denial and restore-free domain promotion).
- Live run on `:18082` against the compose stack (Owner session, P03 pattern): `/healthz` and
  `/readyz` both ok; anonymous `/api/v1/sites` and `/api/v1/organizations` 401; tenant 201,
  duplicate slug 409 `organization_slug_taken`; site 201, duplicate key 409 `site_key_taken`; first
  host primary, second non-primary, promotion 200, list primary-first; platform patch 200; domain
  removed 204 with the remaining host promoted; site 204; tenant 204 and `GET` 404; `site.created`,
  `site.domain.added`, `site.domain.primary_changed`, `site.updated`, `site.domain.removed`,
  `site.deleted`, `organization.created`, `organization.updated` and `organization.deleted` rows
  in `audit_log` with actor, target and metadata.
- Cross-tenant, live: an organization account (its own role with the tenancy keys, bound at
  organization scope) sees exactly its own organization and site and may create inside them, while
  every read of the other tenant — organization, site, domains, `?organization_id=` filter — and
  every write (`POST /sites` with the other organization, `POST /sites/{other}/domains`, PATCH,
  DELETE) answers **403 cross_organization**; the same calls on its own site answer 200/201. An
  account without a role gets **403 permission_denied** on the way to the handler; opening a
  tenant, and deleting its own, answer **403 platform_only** while renaming it is 200; a
  site-scoped binding that names another tenant's site is refused with `invalid_request`
  (“the site belongs to another organization”). The dev database was left clean
  (organizations 0 · sites 0 · domains 0 · 6 base roles · 1 owner binding).
- Noted for operators: base roles keep the permission set they were created with, so an
  installation that upgrades keeps the new tenancy keys on the Owner only — a tenant grants them
  to a role of its own (proven live); the seed's Owner sync is what keeps the platform owner
  complete.
- CI: the smoke step now also opens a tenant, a site and a domain and re-checks the anonymous 401s;
  the block was rehearsed locally against the built binary before pushing.
- CI run `36199468683` → **success**: `Rust — fmt · clippy · test` ✅ (119 tests, including the five
  tenancy integration tests; the smoke log shows tenant `smoke-organization`, site `main` and domain
  `smoke.omnion.test` with `"is_primary":true` created against the CI service containers) ·
  `Infra — compose config` ✅.
- Next: **P05 — Content v0** (pages + revisions, draft/published, publish/restore, slug rules,
  translations skeleton).

## 2026-09-25 — P05 · Content v0

- New crate `crates/content` (docs/05-VERSIONING.md §4–§7, docs/01-VISION.md §5, §7): `pages`
  (slug unique per site, `page_type`, lifecycle `draft`/`published`/`archived`, a pointer at the
  revision visitors see), `page_revisions` (append-only history with `revision_no`,
  title/body/summary and `restored_from_id`) and `translations` (one value of one field of one
  resource in one language — the content → translations[lang] model, no `title_tr` columns
  anywhere).
- The store keeps the documented rules: revision 1 is written with the page; editing content
  appends `n + 1` and archives the draft it supersedes; publishing freezes the draft, retires
  the revision it replaced and refuses with `no_draft_revision` when nothing is pending;
  restoring copies an older revision forward as a new draft (recording where it came from), so
  history is never rewritten; deleting a page takes its revisions and translation rows with it.
  Migration `0004_content.sql`; partial unique indexes hold "at most one draft, one published"
  in the database itself.
- API surface: `GET|POST /api/v1/pages`, `GET|PATCH|DELETE /api/v1/pages/{id}`,
  `POST /{id}/publish`, `POST /{id}/restore`, `GET /{id}/revisions[/{revision_id}]` and
  `GET|PUT /{id}/revisions/{revision_id}/translations[/{language}]`, all behind the
  `content.pages.*` guards plus the tenancy scope rule (a foreign page answers `403
  cross_organization`); every state change writes an audit row (`page.created`, `page.updated`,
  `page.published`, `page.revision.restored`, `page.translation.updated`, `page.deleted`).
- Proof: `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D
  warnings` clean · `cargo test --workspace` → **140 passed** (content crate 12 unit · api
  content routes 3 unit · 5 content integration against the compose stack). Live run on `:18083`
  against a fresh database (dropped afterwards): page `home` created as v1 draft; publish →
  `published_rev=1`; edit → v2 draft while v1 stayed live; publish → v2; re-publish →
  `no_draft_revision`; restore v1 → v3 draft with `restored_from=<v1>`; publish → v3 live;
  history `v3 published / v2 archived / v1 archived` with v1's row unchanged;
  `PUT .../translations/tr` → `tr/title = Merhaba`, `tr/body = Gövde`; anonymous `/api/v1/pages`
  → `401 unauthenticated`; `_sqlx_migrations` shows version 4 `content`; `audit_log` carries the
  seven `page.*` actions with revision numbers.
- CI: the smoke step now walks the content surface (create → publish → edit → publish → restore
  → translation) and re-checks the anonymous 401. Run `36200626747` → **success** (Rust job
  1m31s; the smoke log shows the page created as a draft, revised to "Welcome to Omnion", and
  the restore row `revision_no: 3, state: draft, restored_from_id: …`) · `Infra — compose
  config` ✅.
- Next: **P06 — Admin app v0** (`apps/admin` Next.js + TS + Tailwind with the API-wired login,
  app shell, pages list and site switcher; root `package.json` + `pnpm-workspace.yaml` +
  `turbo.json` skeleton).

## 2026-09-25 — P06 · Admin app v0

- The JavaScript/TypeScript side of the monorepo is alive: root `package.json` +
  `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (`apps/*`, `packages/*`) + `turbo.json` (`build`/`dev`/`typecheck`), so
  `pnpm build` at the root builds every app through turbo (verified: `1 successful, 1 total`).
- New app `apps/admin/` (Next.js 16 + React 19 + TypeScript 5.9 + Tailwind v4, docs/03-FRONTEND.md):
  the app shell (sidebar sections, sticky header with the current screen, mobile drawer), an
  API-wired sign-in screen, an overview screen with live workspace totals and the account card,
  the pages list of the selected site (state filter, live/draft revision per row, reload, empty
  and error states) and the sites list.
- Same-origin API access: `next.config.ts` forwards `/api/*` to `OMNION_API_URL` (default
  `http://127.0.0.1:8080`), so the API's HttpOnly session cookie stays first-party and no CORS
  rule is needed; a deployment only has to route `/api/*` at the edge.
- Session handling is server-first. `proxy.ts` (Next.js 16's renamed `middleware.ts`) turns
  visitors without a session cookie away from panel routes with a `307` to `/login`, the root
  layout resolves the account through `GET /api/v1/me` with the request's own cookie, and the
  client provider starts from that answer — the browser never probes the session itself, which
  keeps the console clean and shows no flash of protected UI.
- Tailwind v4 with `source(none)` + explicit `@source` roots: the repository also carries a Rust
  `target/` tree, so automatic content detection stays off and the app declares its own folders.
- Proof: `pnpm install` (2 workspace projects) · `pnpm --filter @omnion/admin run typecheck`
  clean · `pnpm --filter @omnion/admin run build` green (7 routes; `ƒ Proxy (Middleware)`) ·
  root `pnpm build` → turbo `1 successful, 1 total` · the compiled stylesheet carries the
  utilities the screens use (`bg-canvas`, `text-muted`, `border-line`, `sm:grid-cols-3`,
  `hover:bg-canvas`, …). Live walk on `:3100` against a fresh database (`omnion_p06_live`,
  dropped afterwards) with the API on `:8080`: seeded one tenant → one site → two pages (one
  published with a newer draft, one draft-only) through the API, then drove the panel in a real
  browser (Playwright): anonymous `/` → **307** to `/login`; a wrong password shows the API's
  own refusal (`email or password is incorrect`); the bootstrap account signs in and lands on
  the overview with totals `1 site / 2 pages / 1 published`; the switcher lists the site; the
  pages list shows `/home · live v1 · draft v2` and `/about · not published · draft v1`; the
  state filter narrows the list to the published page; the sites list marks the selected site;
  sign-out clears the cookie and a guarded route answers with `/login`. **17/17 checks passed,
  0 console errors** (the only rejected request in the whole walk is the deliberate wrong
  password on `/api/v1/auth/login`). Screenshot: `/tmp/omnion_p06_pages.png`.
- Next: **P07 — Public web v0** (`apps/web` server-side renderer for published pages + the
  `themes/minimal` stub, `GET /:slug` renders).

## 2026-09-25 — P07 · Public web v0

- The platform now *serves* a site, not just manages one. `crates/identity` gained
  `find_site_by_global_key` (a key resolves platform-wide only when exactly one site carries it —
  keys are unique per organization), and `apps/api` gained the **public surface**
  `GET /api/v1/public/pages/{slug}`: unauthenticated, published revisions only, and no internal
  identifiers in the payload (site key + name · page slug/type/updated_at · revision
  number/title/body/summary/published_at).
- Site resolution is part of the request, documented in `apps/api/src/routes/public.rs`: `?site=`
  (a host when it contains a dot, otherwise a key) → `X-Forwarded-Host`/`Host` with the port
  dropped → the installation's only site when there is exactly one. An address that matches
  nothing answers `404` — and it answers the *same* `404` for "unknown" and "not published", so
  the public surface never discloses a draft. An address that is not a slug shape is a `404` too,
  never a `400`: the panel's validation rules stay in the panel.
- New JavaScript side: `packages/types` (the public content shapes — types-only), `packages/theme-sdk`
  (the theme contract: `SiteTheme`, `PageLayoutProps`, `ThemeManifest`, `defineTheme`),
  `themes/minimal` (manifest + `PageLayout` + stylesheet; warm cream/ink/terracotta palette with a
  light/dark pair), and `apps/web` — Next.js 16 renderer where `app/[[...slug]]/page.tsx` serves the
  site's `home` page at `/` and any published page at `/{slug}` (`force-dynamic`, so a publish is
  visible without a rebuild), `lib/api.ts` reads the API server-side and forwards the visitor's host
  as the site hint unless it is a loopback address, `lib/theme.ts` is the theme registry, and
  `lib/metadata.ts` emits title/description plus canonical and Open Graph URLs when
  `OMNION_SITE_URL` is set. `pnpm-workspace.yaml` now includes `themes/*`.
- Proof: `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
  clean · `cargo test --workspace` → **145 passed** (api unit 33 incl. the new hint/host helpers ·
  public integration 2 · the rest unchanged) · `pnpm --filter @omnion/web run typecheck` clean ·
  `pnpm --filter @omnion/web run build` green (`ƒ /[[...slug]]` server-rendered on demand) · root
  `pnpm build` → turbo `2 successful, 2 total`.
- Live walk on a fresh database (`omnion_p07_live`, dropped afterwards; API on `:18090`, renderer on
  `:3200`): the draft answers `404` on the public surface; after publishing, the public read answers
  `200` through `?site=main`, through `Host: p07.omnion.test` and with no hint at all (single-site
  fallback); `GET /home` returns 7509 bytes of HTML containing the title, the body paragraph,
  `Powered by Omnion` and `data-theme="minimal"`; `GET /` serves the home page; `GET /` with
  `Host: p07.omnion.test` renders through the renderer's host forwarding; `/missing` and the
  draft-only `/soon` answer the not-found view; a revision published while the renderer kept running
  appeared in the HTML without a restart; the theme's stylesheet came back with its `--mn-accent`
  token.
- CI: the smoke step now also reads the published page through the public surface (by key and by the
  site's own domain), and it creates a page that is never published to assert the public `404`. The
  block was rehearsed locally against the built binary first (`SMOKE BLOCK REHEARSAL OK:
  public_title=Welcome to Omnion host_title=Welcome to Omnion draft=404`).
- CI run `36202889332` → **success**: `Rust — fmt · clippy · test` ✅ (the public integration suite
  ran in CI — `Running tests/public.rs` → `2 passed` — and the smoke log prints the public evidence:
  `public surface: title="Welcome to Omnion" via-key · "Welcome to Omnion" via-domain ·
  unpublished=404`) · `Infra — compose config` ✅.
- Next: **P08 — Media v0** (`crates/storage` S3/MinIO abstraction, upload endpoint, media table and
  the public serve path).

## 2026-09-26 — P08 · Media v0

- `crates/storage` (`omnion-storage`): the object-storage abstraction behind the media library —
  a key validator (`keys.rs`, the shape that cannot leave a storage root), SigV4 signing of its own
  S3 requests (`signing.rs`; unit-tested against the published example request — canonical request,
  string-to-sign and signature), an S3/MinIO driver (`s3.rs`: path-style addressing, `NoSuchBucket`
  → create the bucket and retry once, and a `probe` that tells a missing bucket from an unreachable
  store) and a file-system driver for local runs (`fs.rs`). `Storage::from_config`/`from_env` pick
  the driver from `StorageConfig` (`OMNION_STORAGE_DRIVER=s3|fs`, `OMNION_S3_*`, `OMNION_STORAGE_DIR`);
  the secret key is never rendered.
- `crates/media` (`omnion-media`): the row half — the `Media`/`NewMedia` model, the `media` table
  queries and the rules the outside world meets: `sanitize_filename` (path dropped, symbols reduced,
  extension kept), `normalize_content_type` (`type/subtype` only), `object_key` built from ids, and
  `serve_plan` — the inline allow-list (images, video, audio, PDF, `text/plain`); everything else
  leaves as `application/octet-stream` + `attachment` with `nosniff`, so an uploaded document can
  never become markup or script on the platform's own origin.
- `database/migrations/0005_media.sql`: one row per stored object (site, object key, file name,
  content type, size, SHA-256 checksum, uploader) with a unique object key, `size > 0` and shaped
  content-type/checksum constraints; sites cascade, so a removed tenant takes its library with it.
- API (`/api/v1/media`): `POST` (multipart, `media.upload`; the route's own body limit is the
  library's 25 MB plus framing slack; the row is written *after* the object is stored and the object
  is dropped again when the row is refused), `GET` list and metadata (`media.read`),
  `GET /{id}/raw` (`media.read`), `DELETE` (`media.delete` — object first, so a refused store never
  leaves bytes nothing points at). Every handler applies the tenancy scope rule through the site and
  writes an audit row (`media.uploaded`, `media.deleted`). The renderer's read path is
  unauthenticated like the rest of the public surface: `GET /api/v1/public/media/{id}`. `AppState`
  now carries the object store; boot logs `s3://omnion-media` and warns instead of failing when the
  store is down.
- `apps/admin`: the `/media` screen (new nav entry) — the library of the selected site with previews
  for image types, type/size/uploaded columns, an upload button (multipart through the panel's own
  origin) and per-row removal. `lib/api.ts` gained `fetchMedia`/`uploadMedia`/`deleteMedia`/
  `mediaRawUrl` and now only sets `content-type: application/json` for string bodies, so `FormData`
  keeps the browser's own multipart boundary; `lib/format.ts` gained `formatBytes`.
- Proof: `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
  clean · `cargo test --workspace` → **190 passed** (storage 25 · media 12 · api unit 40 · the new
  media integration suite **6** against the live compose stack) ✅ · root `pnpm build` for the admin
  app green (`ƒ /media` in the route table) ✅.
- Live walk (fresh database `omnion_p08_live`, API on `:18090`, admin on `:3100`, MinIO from
  `infra/compose`): sign-in → tenant + site → upload `omnion-media.txt` (19 B, `text/plain`,
  sha256 `11933807907f32bd…`) → the listing carries it with both read paths → `/raw` answers the very
  bytes (`cmp` identical, `type=text/plain`) and `/public/media/{id}` the same bytes with no session
  → anonymous `GET /api/v1/media` → `401` → `DELETE` → `204` → `/raw` afterwards → `404`; the object
  shows up in the MinIO data directory and is gone once deleted. Admin: Playwright signs in, opens
  `/media`, and the table lists `omnion-admin-fixture.txt` (`text/plain`, 27 B) — **the file is
  listed in the panel** ✅ with 0 console errors.
- Note for deployments: the admin's `/api/*` rewrite destination is baked at build time, so a panel
  pointed at a non-default API origin has to be *built* with `OMNION_API_URL` set; setting it only
  at `next start` answers `500` (`ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8080`).
- CI: a `Start the object store (media library)` step brings MinIO up the way `infra/compose` does
  (service containers cannot pass a command) and the smoke step now walks the media round trip —
  upload → list → `cmp` both read paths → anonymous `401` → delete → `404`. Run `36204518708` →
  **success**: `Rust — fmt · clippy · test` ✅ (the media integration suite ran in CI —
  `a_file_round_trips_from_upload_to_fetch ... ok`, `the_media_surface_is_permission_gated ... ok`,
  `an_upload_into_another_tenant_is_refused ... ok`, `test result: ok. 6 passed` — and the smoke log
  prints the media evidence: `media surface: library=1 file(s), first=omnion-media.txt 19 B
  text/plain · round-trip=ok · public=ok · removed=404`, after the new step printed
  `object store: 200`) · `Infra — compose config` ✅.
- Next: **P09 — Workflow engine v0** (`crates/workflows`: durable step store, background runner,
  step retries with backoff, wait-sweeper, manual + schedule triggers).

## 2026-09-26 — P09 · Workflow engine v0

- `crates/workflows` (`omnion-workflows`): the durable step engine behind the automation surface
  (docs/requests/REQ-003; design lessons from docs/09-N8N-TEARDOWN.md §13). A definition is a
  trigger plus an ordered step list — `definition.rs` (manual or cron schedule, 1–50 uniquely
  named steps, attempt cap five, waits 1 s–1 day), `cron.rs` (a five-field cron subset in UTC:
  lists, ranges, steps, month/weekday names, the classic day-of-month/day-of-week union — no
  dependency), `actions.rs` (the closed built-in action set `noop`, `echo`, `fail`, `transient`:
  no dynamic code in the core process, lesson 14), `store.rs` (the durable step store: claim,
  park, retry, settle, cancel, sweep — written so two instances racing over one row still hand
  each step to exactly one runner) and `engine.rs` (the policy: what one tick does, what the
  sweep repairs).
- Durable by construction: starting a run materialises one `workflow_steps` row per step, with
  `available_at` carrying both the retry backoff and the wait deadline. A wait parks the run (a
  write, not a sleep) and is resumed by the runner's next claim or by the sweep; a failing step
  is re-queued with an exponential backoff (5 s → 300 s by default) until its attempts run out;
  a claim older than the lease (5 min) is reclaimed by the sweep with an honest outcome — the
  next attempt for a task step, another park for a wait, and a clean failure when the lost
  attempt was the last one, so every run still reaches a terminal state.
- `database/migrations/0006_workflows.sql`: `workflows`, `workflow_executions`,
  `workflow_steps` with the constraints the engine leans on (status vocabularies, trigger shape,
  `attempts` never above the cap, one row per step position, cascade from the organization down).
- API (`/api/v1/workflows`, `/api/v1/workflow-executions`): create / read / replace / remove a
  definition, list its run history, read one run with every step, start a run and cancel one. The
  three new keys (`workflows.read`, `workflows.manage`, `workflows.run`) are catalogued and reach
  the operational roles (manager all three, moderator read+run, editor read). Definition changes
  and cancellations are audited by the handlers; the engine audits the run lifecycle
  (`workflow.execution.started|completed|failed|cancelled`).
- `apps/api/src/workflow_runner.rs`: the background runner — one task inside the API process, on
  by default — ticks the engine every `OMNION_WORKFLOW_TICK_MS` (default 1 s) and sweeps every
  `OMNION_WORKFLOW_SWEEP_SECONDS` (default 30 s); batch, scheduler batch and the retry base/max
  are configurable too (`OMNION_WORKFLOW_*`), and `OMNION_WORKFLOW_RUNNER=false` keeps a process
  from running the engine at all.
- Proof: `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D
  warnings` clean · `cargo test --workspace` → **250 passed, 0 failed** (workflows **36** unit
  tests · the new integration suite `apps/api/tests/workflows.rs` **11** against the live compose
  stack · every other suite unchanged) ✅
- Live walk (fresh database `omnion_p09_live`, API on `:18091`, runner tick 200 ms / sweep 1 s /
  retry base 400 ms): the Owner created a four-step workflow (noop → transient(`fail_times: 1`,
  3 attempts) → wait(2 s) → echo) and started it. The runner re-queued the failing step
  (`a failing step was re-queued … attempt=1 of=3 delay_ms=400`), parked the wait (`a wait step
  parked the run … seconds=2`), resumed it and finished the run — the API then read
  `completed step2.attempts=2 step3=succeeded step4=succeeded`. A second run parked on a 600 s
  wait was cancelled (`cancelled`, steps `cancelled`+`succeeded`), the second cancel answered
  `409 execution_not_running`. A `* * * * *` workflow fired by itself
  (`a scheduled workflow started …`) exactly once with `trigger=schedule`. The audit trail held
  9 rows (`started` ×3, `completed` ×2, `cancelled` ×1, `created` ×3) and both workflow routes
  answered `401` without a session.
- CI: the smoke step now walks a workflow as well — define the four-step run, start it, poll the
  execution until it settles, assert `completed` with `attempts=2` on the retried step, print the
  workflow audit rows, and prove `/api/v1/workflows` is closed to anonymous callers. Run
  `36206269819` → **success**: `Rust — fmt · clippy · test` ✅ (the workflow integration suite ran
  in CI — the eleven walks passed against the compose stack — and the smoke log prints
  `a failing step was re-queued … attempt=1 of=3 delay_ms=5000` for the retried step, then
  `workflow surface: completed attempts=2 wait=succeeded · run=completed` with
  `workflow audit rows: 19`) · `Infra — compose config` ✅.
- Next: **P10 — Onboarding v0 (REQ-050)** (first-run wizard + `omnion` CLI skeleton).

### Lessons

- A wait step must be resumable whichever mechanism wakes it: deciding "park or resume" from the
  status the row had before the claim broke as soon as the sweeper re-queued a due wait — the
  parked step parked itself again (caught by the attempts constraint as a `23514`). Deciding on
  the claim count (`attempts > 1` ⇒ resume) makes the runner's claim and the sweep agree, and the
  database constraint turned a silent double-park into a failing test.
- An audit row is a second write: a probe that reads the state the moment it flips can land in
  the millisecond before the audit arrives. Positive audit assertions must poll (state → audit is
  the deliberate order); keep the negative ones reading immediately.
- A claim is a LEASE, not a lock. A runner that stops mid-step leaves a `running` row whose
  attempt is already counted, and nothing else would move it again: the run would stay open
  forever and block its own later steps. The sweep reclaims claims older than the lease.
- Test-fleet hygiene: a panicking test skips its cleanup, and the next run's engine ticks walk
  into those rows (a leftover wait at its attempt cap failed an unrelated suite with a constraint
  error). Sweep the suite's own prefix once per process (`OnceCell`) before fixtures appear, and
  keep the test runner's lease longer than any test step so the reclaim path only fires in the
  walk that asks for it.

## 2026-09-26 — P10 · Onboarding v0 (REQ-050)

- `crates/onboarding` (`omnion-onboarding`): the first run of an installation as one flow both
  front ends drive — `steps.rs` (owner account → organization → first site with its domain →
  theme → AI decision → close), `state.rs` (the `onboarding_state` singleton, the derived step
  status and the summary) and `checklist.rs` (the getting-started items, derived from the
  platform's own rows). The owner step binds the Owner role through the same seeding path the API
  runs at boot; every step is audited; an installation whose first account came from the
  environment bootstrap finishes its first run through the wizard too (the oldest active account
  acts as its owner).
- `database/migrations/0007_onboarding.sql`: `sites.theme` (the presentation setting the renderer
  activates) and the `onboarding_state` singleton, one timestamp per step.
- `tools/cli` (`omnion-cli`, binary `omnion`): `setup` (interactive, flag-driven or fully
  non-interactive; the password never echoes), `doctor` (six checks in boot order, actionable
  hints, non-zero exit when one fails) and `migrate` (before/after migration status). The CLI
  reads the same typed configuration the API does and runs the same flow code.
- `apps/api`: `/api/v1/onboarding` — `GET` (open: how far the first run has come) plus `owner`,
  `organization`, `site`, `theme`, `ai-provider` and `complete`, guarded by the flow itself (no
  permission guard: there is nothing to check against before an account exists). The site body
  and the public page response carry the site's theme now, and `PATCH /sites/{id}` accepts one.
- `apps/admin`: the `/setup` wizard (five steps + done screen, Lucide icons only, resumable from
  the server's step status), a sign-in redirect for a fresh installation, the getting-started
  checklist card on the dashboard and a theme selector on Sites. `apps/web` resolves the theme the
  site carries, so choosing one changes what visitors see.
- Proof: `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D
  warnings` clean · `cargo test --workspace` → **272 passed, 0 failed** across 32 suites (the new
  `crates/onboarding` unit tests and `apps/api/tests/onboarding.rs` — four walks on throwaway
  databases) ✅
- Live walks (each on a database created empty for the run):
  1. **wizard surface over HTTP** (`:18092`): `needs_setup` → owner (auto sign-in) → organization
     → site+domain → an unknown theme refused (`400 unknown_theme`) → theme → AI skip → complete;
     the owner then reads `/organizations` and `/sites` through the regular API; six
     `onboarding.*` audit rows; a second owner attempt answers `409 already_installed` and an
     anonymous step `401` ✅
  2. **the browser** (admin panel `:3101` against API `:18094`, Chromium under Xvfb): 10/10 checks
     with 0 console errors — all five steps walk, the dashboard shows the checklist (6 items, 2
     open), Sites shows the theme select, and a finished installation redirects `/setup` back to
     the panel; read back from the database: 1 user, 1 organization, 1 site (`theme=minimal`),
     1 domain, `onboarding_completed=true` ✅
  3. **the CLI** on a fresh database: `doctor` fails on an unmigrated schema (exit 1, hint
     `omnion migrate`), `migrate` applies 7 migrations, `doctor` passes, `setup --non-interactive`
     creates everything, the API serves it (login + the site with its theme), and a second
     `setup` is refused with exit 2 ✅
- CI: the smoke job builds the CLI too and runs a first-run walk on a database that has never been
  migrated (`omnion doctor` refuses the unmigrated schema, `migrate` applies it, `setup` creates
  the installation, the API serves it). Run `36208527271` → **success** (the walk prints
  `doctor reported the pending schema (exit 1, as expected)`, `Setup complete.` …
  `onboarding: completed · steps {'owner': True, …} · themes ['minimal']`,
  `site: ci-site theme=minimal`) · `Infra — compose config` ✅
- Also fixed: the P09 workflow suite's walks are serialised behind a walk lock — its sweeps work
  on the whole `workflows` table, so two walks in flight could settle each other's rows (4 of 5
  runs failed before the lock, 5 of 5 pass after).
- Next: **P11 — AI Hub v0** (docs/06: provider abstraction, providers/models tables, streaming
  chat endpoint, provider configuration in the admin panel).

### Lessons

- An onboarding flow must be *derived*, not remembered: every step's status comes from the
  platform's own rows (accounts, organizations, sites, the theme on the site), so a refresh, a
  second tab, or an installation set up through the API directly all resume correctly without a
  client-side state machine.
- A wizard's first step cannot require a session: the endpoint that creates the owner account is
  open by necessity, so its safety has to come from the data rule (only while the installation
  has no accounts at all) — with the unique index as the backstop for two callers racing.
- The admin panel bakes `rewrites()` into the build: pointing it at a different API origin only
  takes effect after `next build`, so a browser walk must build the panel for the API port it
  will talk to (a runtime env var is not enough).
- This container's Chromium refuses `Page.captureScreenshot` even under Xvfb: a browser walk has
  to treat pictures as a bonus and assert on the DOM (step-state attributes, checklist items,
  console errors) instead of on screenshots.
- Two walks that share a table-wide repair pass cannot run at once: `engine::sweep` is
  deliberately global, so the workflow suite now holds a walk lock — determinism is worth the
  extra ~17 s of serial runtime, and a flake that fails 4 of 5 runs is a bug, not weather.

## 2026-09-26 — P11 · AI Hub v0 (docs/06)

- New crate `crates/ai-hub` (`omnion-ai-hub`) — the platform's single door to AI. `model.rs` holds
  the stored shapes and their validation (a provider is a name, a protocol, a base URL and a
  write-only key; a model is a wire key plus the capability metadata of docs/06 §3); `store.rs`
  keeps the two data rules the rest of the platform leans on — at most one default provider, and a
  default model that is always an enabled one (a switch-off, a removal, a replaced model list or a
  deleted provider repairs the default, or leaves the installation without one — never with a
  model that cannot answer); `client.rs` is the OpenAI-compatible wire client (`chat`,
  `stream_chat` with an SSE decoder built against frames rather than chunks, and
  `list_remote_models`); `router.rs` resolves a request to one `(provider, model)` pair — an
  explicit `provider/model`, a bare key searched across the enabled providers (default provider
  first, and a model key may itself carry a slash), or the installation's default model.
- `database/migrations/0008_ai_hub.sql`: `ai_providers` + `ai_models`, with the partial unique
  indexes that make the two rules the database's own (one default provider, one default model),
  case-insensitive provider names, a base-URL shape check and a cascade from a provider to its
  models.
- Permissions: `ai.providers.read`, `ai.providers.manage` and `ai.chat` (category `ai`) —
  connecting an endpoint and using the platform's AI are separate powers. Manager reads the
  registry and chats (managing providers stays with Owner/Administrator), moderator and editor
  chat, member holds none of them.
- API (`/api/v1/ai`): providers list/create/patch/delete (the key goes in and never comes back —
  only `has_api_key` does), the model registry (`GET /ai/models`, `PUT /ai/providers/{id}/models`
  replaces a provider's set, `PATCH /ai/models/{id}` switches or defaults one), discovery against
  the provider itself (`POST /ai/providers/{id}/discover-models`) and `POST /ai/chat`, which
  answers as `text/event-stream`: `start` (the pair the router chose) → `delta` frames → `done`
  with the finish reason and the token usage, or `error` with a stable code. Every exchange is
  audited (`ai.chat.completed` / `ai.chat.failed`) with provider, model and usage.
- `apps/admin`: the `/ai` screen (sidebar entry; provider list with enable / make-default /
  models / remove; a connect form with the key write-only; a model editor with "Discover from
  provider"; the registry with capability flags and default/enable switches; and a Try-it chat
  that streams an answer through the whole chain). `lib/api.ts` gained the typed client, including
  a browser-side `streamChat` that parses the SSE frames.
- `infra/mocks/openai-compatible.mjs`: a dependency-free OpenAI-compatible mock (models list, JSON
  and streamed chat, and a model it refuses with `500`) so the round trip is reproducible locally
  and in CI without a vendor key.
- Proof: `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D
  warnings` clean · `cargo test --workspace` → **303 passed, 0 failed** (ai-hub 26 unit
  tests; `apps/api/tests/ai_hub.rs` is new) · `pnpm --filter @omnion/admin build` green with the
  `ƒ /ai` route and `pnpm --filter @omnion/admin typecheck` clean.
- Live walk (fresh database `omnion_p11_live`, API `:18096`, mock on `:8123`): sign-in; connect
  `Local Mock` (`http://127.0.0.1:8123/v1/` — the trailing slash normalized away, key stored,
  `model_count 2`, no key anywhere in the responses); the registry lists both models with
  `Local Mock/mock-large` as the default; discovery returns the provider's own list; a chat
  addressed as `Local Mock/mock-large` streams `start` + 5 deltas + `done`
  (`chars=33 · total_tokens=12`) and reassembles to `Hello from the mock (mock-large).`; the same
  without a model named (the router takes the default); a model the provider refuses arrives as
  `event: error {"code":"provider_error", … 500 …}`; an anonymous chat is `401`; the audit trail
  holds 7 `ai.*` rows across five actions.
- Browser walk (admin panel `:3100` against the API, Chromium): **10/10** checks — sign-in, the
  sidebar entry, the provider row, the model rows with the default marked, a chat streaming
  through the UI (`Hello from the mock (mock-large).` · route `Local Mock · mock-large ·
  openai_compatible` · usage `33 characters · 12 tokens · stop`), a model becoming the default
  from its row, and 0 console errors.
- CI: a new `AI Hub walk (mock provider)` step starts the mock and a second API instance, connects
  the provider, streams a chat, asserts the reassembled answer, the `provider_error` frame and the
  anonymous `401`, and prints the `ai.*` audit rows. Its script was dry-run locally against the
  live stack first (`exit 0`, `ai chat stream: deltas=5 reassembled="Hello from the mock
  (mock-large)."`). Run `36210119981` → **success**: `Rust — fmt · clippy · test` ✅ (the walk
  printed `ai registry: 2 model(s), default=mock-large`, `ai chat stream: deltas=5
  reassembled="Hello from the mock (mock-large)."`, `ai audit rows: 4 [… ai.chat.completed ·
  ai.chat.failed · ai.provider.connected · ai.provider.models_replaced]` and `ai hub:
  provider=… · registry=ok · chat=streamed · refusal=reported · anonymous=401`) ·
  `Infra — compose config` ✅.
- Next: **P12 — Events + Webhooks v0** (event bus table + delivery worker + HMAC signatures, first
  fan-out `page.published`).

### Lessons

- A provider key is a one-way shape: the API's provider body has no field for it (`has_api_key` is
  derived), so "the key never comes back" is a grep over the responses rather than an audit of
  every handler — design the response type so a leak would need a new field.
- Two invariants belong to the schema, not to validation code: "one default provider" and "the
  default model is always enabled" are partial unique indexes plus one `repair_default_model` pass
  that every write path calls. The database refuses the impossible state; the store reforms it
  after each change.
- Streaming has two failure surfaces and both need an answer: everything decidable before the
  first byte stays an HTTP status (routing, permission, request shape), everything after it
  travels as an `error` frame inside the stream. A client that handles only one of them shows a
  half-answer, or a spinner that never stops.
- The SSE decoder is where a provider's personality is: it must survive a JSON object split
  mid-frame, CRLF frames, keep-alive comments, a missing trailing blank line, a usage frame after
  the finish reason, and a refusal smuggled inside a `200` stream. Write it against frames, never
  against "one chunk = one event" — and prove it with frame-level unit tests.
- Two mocks, two jobs: the in-process axum mock keeps the Rust suite hermetic; the zero-dependency
  Node mock makes the same round trip reachable from CI and from a laptop. The CI step's script
  was dry-run locally before it was committed — and the dry run found that 8081 on this box is the
  Pterodactyl Wings daemon, not a free port (`ss -tlpn` before trusting a port).

## 2026-09-26 — P12 · Events + Webhooks v0 (docs/01-VISION.md §13)

- New crate `crates/events` (`omnion-events`) — the platform's event bus and its deliveries.
  `model.rs` holds the recorded event, the endpoint, the queue rows and the attempt budget the
  queue carries; `validation.rs` the shapes the platform refuses to store (a dotted, lower-case
  event name, an absolute http(s) URL, a subscription list, the generated 32-byte secret);
  `signature.rs` the signing scheme (HMAC-SHA256 over `<timestamp>.<raw body>` carried as
  `X-Omnion-Signature: v1=<hex>`, verified in constant time); `store.rs` the SQL (event + fan-out
  in one transaction, `for update skip locked` claims with a lease, settle exactly once, the retry
  ladder); `bus.rs` `emit`/`emit_to`; `sender.rs` one signed POST — the body is serialized once and
  both the request body and the signature are computed from those bytes, so a receiver that
  verifies the raw bytes always agrees; and `engine.rs` `run_due`: settle the queue of endpoints
  that were switched off, claim the due rows, deliver, retry with backoff, fail when the attempts
  run out.
- `database/migrations/0009_events_webhooks.sql`: `events` (dotted-name check, organization/site/
  actor references), `webhook_endpoints` (per-organization case-insensitive unique name, the
  subscription array with a cardinality check, a secret-length check) and `webhook_deliveries`
  (one delivery per endpoint per event, `pending | delivered | failed`, attempts, lease, response
  status, error) with the partial index the claim walks.
- Fan-out: publishing a page records `page.published` (page, site, slug, revision) and the bus
  queues one signed delivery per enabled, subscribed endpoint of that organization — the event row
  and its deliveries are one transaction, so the queue can never reference an event that does not
  exist. An event without an organization fans out to nobody: an endpoint belongs to one tenant,
  and matching it against a platform-level fact would leak between tenants.
- API (`/api/v1/webhooks`, `/api/v1/events`): endpoints list/create/get/patch/delete, the
  operator's test delivery (`POST /webhooks/{id}/test` queues `webhook.test` — even to a
  switched-off endpoint, which is what "test before going live" means), the queue history of one
  endpoint (`GET /webhooks/{id}/deliveries`) and the event feed (`GET /events?name=&limit=`). The
  signing secret is write-only: shown once when the platform generated it, never again, and a
  rotation replaces it silently. Endpoints are tenant resources — an organization account only
  ever sees and changes its own (a cross-tenant read is `403 cross_organization`).
- Permissions: `webhooks.read`, `webhooks.manage`, `events.read` (categories `webhooks`, `events`);
  Manager reads endpoints and the feed, Owner/Administrator pick the new keys up from the catalogue.
- Runner: `apps/api/src/event_runner.rs` ticks the delivery queue in the API process
  (`OMNION_EVENTS_*`, default on) — `poll_ms` 5000, `batch` 20, `lease_seconds` 120,
  `request_timeout_ms` 10000, `retry_base_ms` 15000 → `retry_max_ms` 900000; a queued delivery
  carries its five attempts.
- `infra/mocks/webhook-receiver.mjs`: a dependency-free receiver that verifies the HMAC exactly the
  way a third-party receiver must (and answers `401` when it does not verify). `infra/mocks/
  webhooks-walk.sh`: the end-to-end walk — sign in, tenant + site + page, connect the receiver as
  an endpoint, publish, wait for the signed delivery, read it back from the queue history and the
  event feed. Developer and CI run the same script.

### Verify

- `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` + `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
  green; `cargo test --workspace`: **332 passed, 0 failed** (the events crate contributes 22 unit
  tests, the API suite 2 more walks).
- `apps/api/tests/events.rs` — 2 walks on throwaway databases against a **real receiver this suite
  starts on a loopback port**: connecting an endpoint (secret shown once, never again in any
  response body), the duplicate-name `409` and the unusable-URL `400`, the test delivery, the
  `page.published` fan-out (header + signature + envelope verified by the receiver's own verifier,
  the queue history showing `delivered / attempts=1 / 200`, the event feed showing the payload), a
  receiver that answers `500` once (the delivery stays `pending` with `attempts=1` and the refusal
  in `error`, then delivers on the retry with `attempts=2`), a receiver that never accepts (five
  attempts, then `failed` with `response_status=500` — the receiver saw every one), the tenant
  scope (two organizations, one event, only the owning organization's endpoint receives it and
  nothing is queued for the other), the permission gates (`401` anonymous, `403` for a member
  without the keys, `403` for cross-tenant reads) and the switched-off endpoint (its queued
  delivery settles as `failed` with the reason instead of sitting pending forever).
- Live walk on this machine — the API binary on `:8082` against a throwaway database plus
  `webhook-receiver.mjs` on `:8124`, driven by the committed `infra/mocks/webhooks-walk.sh`:
  `receiver: event=page.published signature=verified bytes=477 slug=home` ·
  `platform: status=delivered attempts=1 response=200 event=page.published` ·
  `bus: 1 page.published event(s) on the feed` · `webhooks walk: OK — signed delivery verified end
  to end`; the API's own log: `event recorded event_id=1 name=page.published deliveries=1` followed
  by `webhook delivered delivery_id=cc2ff733-b27f-4b62-aa41-e39e343e084c endpoint=Walk Receiver
  event=page.published status=200 attempt=1`.
- CI: the `Webhooks walk (signed delivery)` step starts the receiver and a second API instance and
  runs the same script (dry-run locally: exit 0).
- Next: **P13 — Automation v0 (REQ-003 lite)** — trigger → condition → action on top of P09.

### Lessons

- One transaction for "the fact" and "who must hear about it": an event row and its queued
  deliveries commit together, which removes the class of bug where a delivery points at an event
  that was never recorded. The trade-off is explicit — subscriptions are matched at emission time,
  so an endpoint connected later receives nothing retroactively.
- Sign the exact bytes you send. Serialize the body once, sign those bytes, put those bytes on the
  wire; a receiver that re-serializes a parsed body will verify in one language and fail in another
  (key order, unicode escaping, float formatting).
- The timestamp belongs inside the signed material: a receiver gets replay protection by comparing
  it with its own clock, and Omnion needs no extra state to make the promise.
- A queue row carries its own budget (`max_attempts`) and its attempts are counted when it is
  claimed, not when it succeeds — so a process that dies mid-delivery still consumes an attempt and
  a crash loop cannot retry forever.
- "Switched off" needs an answer for the queue too: pending deliveries of a disabled endpoint are
  settled as failed with the reason. Otherwise the history shows a queue that never moves and the
  operator cannot tell why nothing arrived.
- The last mile is the delivery id: `X-Omnion-Delivery` is the row's own id, which is what makes
  the receiver's log and the panel's delivery list talk about the same attempt.

## 2026-09-26 — P13 · Automation v0 (REQ-003 lite)

- New crate `crates/automation` (`omnion-automation`) — trigger → condition → action on top of the
  P09 engine, with the docs/09-N8N-TEARDOWN §13 lessons applied: an automation rule **is** a
  workflow whose `trigger_kind = 'event'` (storage reflects what it is — no parallel rule table),
  the comparison set is closed and small (9 operators: `equals`, `not_equals`, `contains`,
  `not_contains`, `starts_with`, `ends_with`, `in`, `exists`, `not_exists` — no expression
  language), and no dynamic code ever runs in the core process. `model.rs` the rule + run shapes;
  `condition.rs` the evaluator (every condition must hold; a field the payload does not answer is
  false, and the skip audit says why); `binding.rs` the `{{ }}` bindings an action may fill from
  the payload — a binding the event cannot fill **refuses to start** the run (no half-filled
  steps); `matcher.rs` the drain — **one tick = one transaction**: read the events above the
  cursor, evaluate the armed rules of their tenants, start one durable run per match, advance the
  cursor; `for update skip locked` makes the cursor row itself the concurrency lock, so
  exactly-once holds across instances.
- Cursor: seeded to the end of the bus **once at boot** (`matcher::seed_cursor`, called by
  `automation_runner` before its first tick) — a fresh installation watches forward; on an empty
  bus that seed lands on `0`, which is precisely why the drain reads everything above it. The
  lazy-seed branch inside the drain was removed: the E2E walk caught it swallowing the first real
  event (it re-read `0` as "never seeded" and stepped the cursor past the event the rule was
  waiting for).
- Actions: `send_email` — the SMTP wire protocol written out in `mail.rs` (`EHLO` → optional
  `AUTH PLAIN` → `MAIL FROM` → one `RCPT TO` per recipient → `DATA` → `QUIT`; multi-line replies
  read in full; dot-stuffed bodies), master switch `OMNION_MAIL_ENABLED`, and a switched-off
  server fails the step **with that reason** — and `comment_revision` — a comment on the revision
  the event names (`crates/content/src/comments.rs`). Synthetic actions (`noop`, `echo`, `fail`,
  `transient`) stay pure in-engine; they are what the suite drives the engine with.
- `database/migrations/0010_automation.sql`: the cursor row + the run table + the P09 constraint
  work the E2E walk exposed — `workflows_trigger_kind_valid` did not know `'event'` and
  `workflows_schedule_shape` had no event branch, so an event rule fell through both checks; both
  are dropped and re-added (three-branch shape), plus `trigger_event`/`conditions` columns and
  `workflows_trigger_event_shape`.
- API: `/api/v1/automations` (list/create/get/update/delete) + `/automations/catalogue` (the closed
  vocabulary a rule may be written in), reusing `workflows.read`/`workflows.manage`; rules are
  tenant resources and the surface is permission-gated. The matcher runs in the API process:
  `OMNION_AUTOMATION_RUNNER` (default on), `OMNION_AUTOMATION_POLL_MS`, `OMNION_AUTOMATION_BATCH`.
- Proof: `cargo fmt --all -- --check` → clean · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D
  warnings` → clean · `cargo test --workspace --lib` → **328 passed** · `cargo test -p omnion-api
  --tests` → **58 + 56 integration (13 files, incl. the new `tests/automation.rs`)**.
  `apps/api/tests/automation.rs` — 5 walks on a throwaway DB with a real in-process SMTP sink: the
  full page.published → conditions → `send_email` + `comment_revision` run end to end —
  `matcher: evaluated=1 matched=1 skipped=0 run=5029f197-…` · `engine: run="completed" step1={action:
  send_email, subject: "Published: Release notes", to: editor@example.com} step2={action:
  comment_revision, comment_id: 6d5b166d-…}` · `sink: to=editor@example.com subject="Published:
  Release notes" bytes=314 commands=5` — plus: a false condition and an unheard event start nothing,
  a binding the event cannot fill refuses the run, a switched-off mail server fails the step with
  that reason (`step_error="the email could not be sent: sending email is switched off
  (OMNION_MAIL_ENABLED=false)"`), and the surface stays permission-gated + tenant-scoped.
- Next: **P14 — Polish + CI v0** (make the CI workflow run for real + README quickstart).

## 2026-09-26 — P14 · Polish + CI v0

- CI gains the `Web — install · typecheck · build · serve (admin + public renderer)` job: pnpm comes
  from the root `packageManager` field (no version pinned twice), `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`,
  `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm build` (both Next.js apps through turbo), and then the panel is booted and
  has to keep the promise a reader cares about — the sign-in screen answers `200` while an anonymous
  panel route is redirected (`307`) to it. The job deliberately needs no API: it is what a fresh
  clone can show before anything is configured.
- README rewritten around a quickstart a fresh clone can follow: the compose stack (table of services
  and ports) → `cargo run -p omnion-api` → first run (`omnion setup` or the `/setup` wizard) → the
  admin panel → the public renderer, followed by the checks CI runs, the repository layout and the
  documentation map. Every command in it was executed on the dev stack first.
- Proof: CI run `36213754270` (head `3a8de29`) → **success**, all three jobs — the web job (40 s)
  logged `admin panel: /login=200 · anonymous /pages=307 → /login`, and `Rust — fmt · clippy · test`
  (smoke + AI-hub + webhooks + first-run walks) plus `Infra — compose config` stayed green. Local
  dry runs: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` → "Already up to date" · `pnpm typecheck` → 2/2 ·
  `pnpm build` → 2 successful · `/healthz` 200 · `/readyz` database+redis ok · `omnion doctor` 6/6.
- Next: **P15+ — REQ-driven queue** (`docs/requests/REQ-XXX`, owner steers priority; suggested first
  REQ-016 webhooks centre → REQ-002 command centre). The foundation phases P00–P14 are complete.

## 2026-09-26 — REQ-002 · Global search (slice 1: the index and the query core)

- The platform's search is an **index**, not a scatter of per-table queries: `crates/search` owns a
  provider registry (pages, media, users, sites — one entry each: key, document type, the read
  permission its hits require, the panel route a hit opens), an indexer that writes one
  `search_documents` row per searchable thing (`database/migrations/0012_search.sql`), and a query
  engine that narrows by organization, by the caller's provider permissions and by the scoped
  syntax (`type:`, `site:`, `owner:me`, `before:`/`after:`, `is:draft`) inside the SQL — never
  after paging. Ranking is `ts_rank_cd` over the document vector (title A / tags B / subtitle C /
  body D) with the installation's weights (normalised into the range PostgreSQL accepts) plus a
  `pg_trgm` prefix and near-miss match.
- The index keeps itself fresh from the bus: `apps/api/src/search_runner.rs` walks the events
  above a cursor row (`for update skip locked`) and applies each one to its provider;
  `POST /api/v1/search/reindex` rebuilds a provider (or all) idempotently — upsert plus prune, so
  a second pass writes the same count — and leaves an audit row and a `search.reindexed` event.
  The API surface is `/api/v1/search` (ranked hits, per-provider counts, honest hints),
  `/search/suggest` (title prefixes), `/search/status` and `/search/recent` (GET/DELETE). Two new
  permission keys: `search.read` (the box; every base role holds it) and `search.manage` (index
  operations).
- Proof: `cargo fmt --all -- --check` → clean · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D
  warnings` → clean · `cargo test --workspace` → **421 passed, 0 failed (44 suites)**, including
  the new `apps/api/tests/search.rs` (8 walks: hits across pages + media + users for a librarian
  while an editor without `users.read` gets none; tenancy scope with a platform owner reading
  across organizations; the scoped syntax with an unknown `type:` answering empty *and explained*;
  publishing a page becoming findable within one indexer tick; a reindex idempotent twice over;
  the media removal branch; suggestions; the search history; four refusals) · `pnpm typecheck &&
  pnpm build` → 2/2 successful · `bash scripts/qa/run.sh` → 49 clicks, 49 screenshots, **0 high
  findings, 0 vision issues** (`qa-artifacts/20260926-134405`).
- Deviations from the spec, each deliberate and recorded in the REQ: no dyn `SearchProvider` trait
  (the registry is the seam and the indexer is the single writer), `document` is a plain tsvector
  column (`array_to_string` is STABLE, and generated columns refuse STABLE expressions), weights
  are normalised (`ts_rank_cd` accepts only 0..=1), and the `users`/`sites` hits point at routes
  that arrive with REQ-006 — slice 2 renders a section only for a provider whose route exists, so
  no click goes nowhere.
- Next: **REQ-002 slice 2 — the palette** (header search box, ⌘K overlay, sections by hit count,
  keyboard map, recently viewed, all states, mobile sheet), then slice 3 (`/search` results screen
  with facets/selection/export, `/settings/search`).

## 2026-09-26 — REQ-002 · Global search (slice 2: the ⌘K palette and the results screen)

- The panel has its one box. `⌘K`/`Ctrl+K` opens a palette from any screen, `/` focuses the header
  box without opening anything, typing two characters hands over to the palette. Sections are one
  per provider, ordered by how much each provider matched, five rows each plus "see all"; `↑`/`↓`
  walk the whole list across section boundaries, `Tab` jumps sections, `Enter` opens the
  highlighted row, `⌘Enter` opens it in a new tab, `Esc` closes. The empty query shows the
  account's recent searches (removable one by one, clearable completely) and this browser's
  recently viewed screens; a phone gets the same palette as a full-screen sheet with 44px rows.
  `apps/admin/components/search-palette.tsx` + `global-search.tsx` carry it, `lib/search-palette.ts`
  and `lib/search-memory.ts` the logic and the browser's own memory.
- Hits open the thing they name. The indexer writes deep links now (`/pages?site=…&focus=…`,
  `/media?site=…&focus=…`), the palette switches the panel's site before it navigates, the pages
  screen opens the focused page's editor and the library marks the focused file's row. "See all
  results" lands on `/search`, which ships as the honest half of the results screen (query, sort,
  per-provider counts, rows with the match emphasised, pagination, all three states); facets,
  selection, export and `/settings/search` stay in slice 3.
- Slice 1 promised sections for pages, media, sites and accounts but only content emitted events —
  the index carried plans for the others and no producers, so those sections would have stayed
  empty forever. That half shipped too: `media.created`/`media.deleted`, `site.created`/
  `site.updated` and `user.created` are emitted by the routes that change those rows.
- Proof: `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D
  warnings` clean · `cargo test --workspace` → **422 passed, 0 failed (44 suites)**, including the
  new `an_upload_and_a_new_site_reach_the_index_through_the_bus` (three real routes → one indexer
  tick → indexed, then removed) · `pnpm typecheck && pnpm build` → 2/2 · `bash scripts/qa/run.sh`
  → 58 clicks, 67 screenshots, **0 high findings** (`qa-artifacts/20260926-150923`); the pass's
  palette phase reports open (`focusedInput: true`), two sections for "sample" (Media 1, Pages 1),
  the highlight moving `hit-0-0 → hit-1-0`, the row opening `/pages?site=…&focus=…`, the recents
  surviving a reload, and `close` ✓, while the phone sheet measures 390×844 with 44px rows ·
  `scripts/qa/probe-palette.cjs` → **22/22 PASS** (keyboard map incl. `Ctrl+Enter` in a new tab,
  the no-hits state, recents, the box click, `/`, both console-error checks).
- The QA harness grew teeth and immediately used them. The mobile context is signed in now (every
  "mobile" route had been photographing the sign-in screen — a gap, not a screen), the media
  screen's hidden upload input is set directly (a click-through cannot reach a 0×0 control, so the
  library — and everything indexed from it — stayed empty), and an open palette is closed before
  the next round clicks. Real mobile screens then showed a pages table that overflowed a phone and
  a corrupt 82-byte "PNG" fixture that rendered as a broken thumbnail; both fixed here (narrow
  columns and action labels leave before the table does; the fixture is a real 160×120 PNG).
  Overlay screenshots are viewport-only now — a full-page shot of a fixed sheet shows the page
  below the fold and reads as an overlay that fails to cover the screen.
- Carried forward, not caused by this slice: the public renderer answers `404` for its own icon
  requests on every pass (5 medium findings, unchanged since `20260926-134405`), and the vision
  review's one remaining low note guesses the contrast of `text-muted` at ~2.5:1 where the
  harness's own measured check reports zero low-contrast nodes — the token stays as it is.
- Next: **REQ-002 slice 3** — `/search` facets with counts, removable chips, Shift-range + `⌘A`
  selection, Copy links, CSV export (`/search/export`), `/settings/search` (per-provider status,
  ranking weights, reindex progress) and the settings/logs/translations providers; then wave 1
  continues with REQ-032 (command centre).

## 2026-09-26 — REQ-002 slice 3: results depth, the wider provider set, the index's own screen (done)

- The results screen is now the depth the brief asked for. Facets: **Type, Site, Owner, Language,
  Status and Updated**, each with counts and each counted **without its own filter** (so "Pages 12"
  is the number clicking it would leave); applied filters become removable chips; 50 rows a page;
  selection with Shift-range and `⌘A`; Copy links (newline-separated, absolute); CSV export
  (`/search/export`) of the whole result set or of the selection, with the row count in a header;
  the keyboard map (`s` sort, `f` facets, `x` a row, `⌘A` the page, `?` the list); and on phones
  the filters move into a sheet behind `Filters (n)` while the selection bar stays sticky.
- `/settings/search` is new — the index's own screen, reachable from the nav. One row (or card,
  below `md`) per provider: documents, last indexed, **state** (`ready`, `indexing`, `stale`,
  `failed`, `empty`) and the last pass's own numbers, with a Reindex button per provider and for the
  whole index; the ranking weights form (whole numbers, title ≥ body) with the API's validation,
  Restore defaults from the server's own defaults, and a progress line fed by the passes. The
  states are read from `search_reindex_runs` (migration 0013): every pass records what it wrote, how
  long it took and why it failed, so a state is never guessed from a document count.
- Three providers joined the registry, each with a real destination: **Activity** (audit entries
  and recorded events whose target is a page, a file or a site — a row opens the thing it touched),
  **Translations** (a translated field opens its page's editor) and **Settings** (the search
  weights row, one per organization, opening `/settings/search`). The palette renders all three; the
  results screen can filter, select and export them like any other row.
- Proof: `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D
  warnings` clean · `cargo test --workspace` → **436 passed, 0 failed** (five new walks in
  `apps/api/tests/search.rs`: facets leave their own filter out of their own counts, the export
  answers one row per hit and honours `selected=`, the weights flip a fixture's order, the settings
  read/write/refusals, and Activity + Settings are findable with their own screens) · `pnpm
  typecheck && pnpm build` → 2/2 (`/settings/search` in the route table) · `bash scripts/qa/run.sh`
  → 105 clicks, 107 screenshots, **0 high findings**, **0 vision issues**
  (`qa-artifacts/20260926-160500`). The pass's depth phase: 6 facet groups, a type facet narrowed
  13 → 9 hits with one chip, removing it left 0 chips, `s` moved the sort to `newest`, a Shift-range
  selected 3 of 13 rows, Copy links wrote exactly 3 URLs, the exported CSV carried 3 rows (same
  count), the settings screen showed 7 providers with their states, a per-provider reindex answered
  "Indexed 1 document in 15 ms." and its row read `1 written · 0 pruned · 15 ms`.
- The QA harness keeps earning its keep. It caught a real defect in this slice — the settings table
  is a six-column table and a phone reported 7 elements outside the viewport — so the provider rows
  render as cards below `md`, the timestamps no longer wrap, and the disabled Save button stopped
  fading its labelled text (white on pale peach). It also grew a depth phase of its own (facets →
  chips → sort → selection → clipboard → CSV file → shortcuts → reindex → weights), which is what
  makes each of those acceptance claims a number instead of an impression. Two layouts over one
  dataset also taught the harness a selector lesson: `:visible` only, or a click lands on the copy
  that a phone would show.
- Carried forward, not caused by this slice: the public renderer still answers `404` for its own
  icon requests (5 medium findings, unchanged), and the previous pass's single low vision note (the
  overview's `Connect a domain` row) turned out to be a misread — the API and the DOM both report
  the step done, and the re-run reported 0 issues across all 14 screens.
- Next: wave 1 continues with **REQ-032** (command centre: palette + quick actions + recents), then
  REQ-007 (analytics + real dashboard).

## 2026-09-26 — REQ-032 · slice 1 · the palette becomes a command centre

- **Commands are code, not configuration.** `crates/search/src/commands.rs` is the registry (8
  entries today: the panel's screens plus "Create a page"), each naming the permission whose
  holder may run it, the route it opens, keywords, aliases and the screens it is worth suggesting
  on. `visible()` projects it through a caller's effective permissions and `suggest()` picks a
  screen's suggestions — both pure, both unit-tested without a database.
- **The API serves the projection.** `GET /api/v1/commands`, `GET /api/v1/command-center/context`
  and `GET`/`POST`/`DELETE /api/v1/command-center/recent`, all behind `search.read`; migration
  `0014_command_center.sql` adds `command_recents` (per user, trimmed to 50, upserted on repeat)
  and `command_usage_daily`. The palette grew the command group, the `>` `@` `#` `:` `?` prefix
  model with a mode chip, its own Recent list with a Clear control, and focus restoration on `Esc`;
  `/pages?new=1` opens the create form with the cursor already in the title field.
- **Proof:** `cargo fmt`/`clippy` clean · `cargo test --workspace` → **452 passed, 0 failed**
  (9 new walks in `apps/api/tests/command_center.rs`: the projection leaves a member's answer
  without the words "Create a page"/"Open pages", suggestions follow the screen and skip the one
  already open, recents are personal and repeat-safe, the history trims at 50, refusals carry a
  code, an out-of-reach command is dropped on read, every registry id stores) · `pnpm typecheck &&
  pnpm build` → 2/2 · `bash scripts/qa/run.sh` → 105 clicks, 113 screenshots, **0 high findings**,
  **0 vision issues** (`qa-artifacts/20260926-171549`) · `scripts/qa/probe-command-center.cjs` →
  **26/26** (a command lands on its screen and closes the palette, the run is in the account's own
  history when read back through the API, clearing empties it immediately and after a reload, `#qa`
  answers Sites-only, `Tab` walks the groups, no 5xx) · `scripts/qa/probe-palette.cjs` → **22/22**
  (the REQ-002 palette regressions: arrows, `Ctrl+Enter` new tab, no-results, the phone sheet, and
  the query remembered under the renamed Recent group).
- **The pass caught two defects.** (1) The palette opens over the results screen's dialog and the
  scrim closes it without touching the dialog (palette `z 50` over `z 40`), but the harness step
  first clicked the scrim's *centre* — where the dialog sits — and read the interception as a
  failure; it clicks the corner now. (2) A real one: the migration's id-format check rejected
  hyphens, so recording `nav.create-page` answered `500` — invisible to the integration suite
  (which only recorded `nav.pages`/`nav.media`) until the browser probe fired a real one.
  `every_registered_command_can_be_remembered` now walks the whole registry through the endpoint.
- The walkthrough also flagged the pages table pushing its Actions column 21px past a phone's edge,
  so the page cell is now the flexible one (`w-full max-w-0`) — the vision review reports 0 issues.
- Carried forward, not caused by this slice: the public renderer still answers `404` for its own
  icon requests (5 medium findings, unchanged).
- Next: wave 1 continues with **REQ-032 slice 2** (federated search in the palette: per-group
  loading and errors, type filters, the URL-backed `/search`), then REQ-007 (analytics + real
  dashboard).

## 2026-09-26 — REQ-032 · slice 2 · the palette answers in groups

- **Each provider answers on its own.** The palette stopped slicing one answer: it asks every
  provider its own question (`/api/v1/search?q=…&types=pages`) in waves of three, so a section has
  its own skeleton while its request is in flight, its own rows when it answers, and its own
  retryable error — the failure's code and status in the tooltip — when it fails. One slow or
  failing type never blanks the rest. A whole-index count rides behind the first wave for the "see
  all results" total; sections keep the registry's order instead of reshuffling under the reader's
  eyes as answers land.
- **Typing is not a search worth remembering.** The endpoint grew `history=false`; the palette's
  federated calls say it, so `search_recent` stays the record of searches someone committed to
  (a hit opened, a section's "see all", the results screen). The palette's own history is
  `command_recents`, written on commit. Nine parallel calls per keystroke pause also became three
  at a time **because the walkthrough proved it**: with nine in flight the page's own RSC
  prefetches queued behind them and two navigations were recorded as `net::ERR_ABORTED` (high) —
  the cap removed both, `GROUP_CONCURRENCY` in the palette.
- **An empty answer now says which empty it is.** `hidden_total` (a count, never a title, computed
  over the enabled providers the caller's keys do not cover, and only when their own answer is
  empty) lets the results screen and the palette tell "nothing matched" from "nothing you may read
  matched": "N results are outside your permissions." The palette's no-results state also offers
  the way out as real rows — `/search?q=…` and `/ai?q=…` (the AI Hub opens with the words in its
  prompt; nothing is asked on the reader's behalf).
- **A "see all" is a link the screen understands.** `sectionUrl` emits the results screen's own
  `type=<provider>` parameter, so the link lands with its chip applied, its rail already knowing
  which type is on, and the search box still showing the words that were typed.
- **The narrowing is a property of the requests now.** `>` asks the registry and never the index
  (0 calls, 0 sections); `@`/`#`/`:` ask exactly one provider each. A regression of mine —
  `>` + text listed the whole command list instead of the matches, so Enter landed on "Search
  everything" — was caught by the *walkthrough*, not by the new probe: the end-to-end click pass
  is the reason the palette's own commands still work.
- **Proof:** `cargo test --workspace` → **455 passed, 0 failed** (3 new: the count outside a
  reader's scope at the API — counted, titled nowhere, `0` for the reader who sees everything —
  plus the `history=false` walk and its wire test) · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D
  warnings` clean · `pnpm typecheck && pnpm build` 2/2 · `bash scripts/qa/run.sh` → 77 clicks, 98
  screenshots, **0 high findings**, **0 vision issues** (`qa-artifacts/20260926-180233`) ·
  `scripts/qa/probe-palette-federated.cjs` → **32/32** (delayed provider → own skeleton while
  another holds rows; 503 on one type → that section retryable, the rest rendering; `>`/`#`/`:`/`@`
  ask what they say; `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` walk sections; "see all" → `/search?q=…&type=pages` with the
  API's own count, same after a reload; "zzqqxx" → the results screen + a prefilled AI Hub;
  history clean; as the Member: no "Create a page"/"Open sites", the shared sites link renders 0
  rows and "1 result is outside your permissions." with no title in the answer) ·
  `probe-command-center.cjs` **26/26** and `probe-palette.cjs` **22/22** re-run clean (no slice-1
  regressions) · the typing budget, keystroke → row over 20 samples: **p50 197 ms · p95 220 ms ·
  max 237 ms** (criterion: 300 ms p95).
- **Found, not fixed (REQ-002's ground):** creating a draft page emits no event, so a fresh draft
  reaches the index only on a publish or a reindex — the indexer's plan lists `page.created`
  (`crates/search/src/indexer.rs`) but `POST /api/v1/pages` never emits it. The probe works around
  it with an explicit reindex; the gap is worth a REQ-002 follow-up rather than a quiet fix here.
- Carried forward, not caused by this slice: the public renderer still answers `404` for its own
  icon requests (5 medium findings, unchanged).
- Next: REQ-032 stayed in progress — **slice 3** was the next tick's work.

## 2026-09-26 — REQ-032 · slice 3 · the palette acts, and says so

- **A command has a kind.** The registry grew `CommandKind::Action` and a `confirm` flag, and
  `runnable()` answers only for actions — so the API's `not_runnable` refusal cannot drift from what
  the projection says. Two actions ship with the services that exist today: rebuilding the whole
  search index (`search.manage`, asks first) and clearing the account's own palette history (asks
  first; no key beyond being signed in). The four examples in the request — "Create customer",
  "Create workflow", "Run backup", "Switch site" — arrive with their owning services (CRM, the
  workflows screen, a backup service, a palette parameter model), none of which exist yet; the
  pattern for each is now one registry entry + one match arm + one audit expectation.
- **The act is the owning service's code, not a copy.** `search::perform_reindex` (its audit row and
  `search.reindexed` event included) now serves both the settings screen's button and the palette's
  command, and one `clear_recents` serves the palette's Clear control and the `act.clear-recents`
  command — two entry points, one behaviour, no drift possible.
- **The confirmation is a platform rule.** `POST /commands/{id}/run` carries no route-level guard
  on purpose: every command has its own key, so the handler re-checks it, refuses a navigation
  command by name, refuses an unknown id as a 404, and refuses an unconfirmed run with
  `confirmation_required` **before anything executes** — a programmatic caller that skips the card
  still has to say yes. The audit trail is provably unchanged while the palette's question is open
  (the probe reads it before, during and after).
- **One entry and one count per executed command.** `command.run` names actor, command (as the
  target), outcome and the owning service's aggregate result — never a row of content — and
  `command_usage_daily` counts the run (upserted by user/command/day, no query text). A refused run
  writes nothing at all; the probe asserts the trail is unchanged after all three refusals.
- **The palette never invents the outcome.** The result card prints the run endpoint's own message
  ("Rebuilt 7 providers · 18 documents · 95 ms") and links to the screen that reads the record back
  (`/settings/search`, which shows the same pass as the provider's last run). Recents of an action
  command run it again instead of navigating.
- **A defect found and fixed in this tick, not caused by this slice:** the search suite asserted
  that one `indexer::drain(_, 100)` applies its own event; with action-command reindexes on the same
  shared bus (every reindex leaves one `search.reindexed` per provider, and those are skipped rather
  than applied) a single batch can be spent on history the suite does not own. The suite now ticks
  the way the runner does — bounded batches until one applies something.
- **Proof:** `cargo test --workspace` → **463 passed, 0 failed** (8 new walks: 3 registry + 5
  command-centre) · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` → clean · `pnpm
  typecheck && pnpm build` → 2/2 · `bash scripts/qa/run.sh` → 105 clicks, 115 screenshots, **0 high

  `probe-palette-federated.cjs` **32/32** · the walkthrough's own steps record
  `ranNothingYet: true` (nothing ran while the question was open) and `newEntries: 1` with
  `target: act.reindex-search`, `outcome: ok`.
- Carried forward, not caused by this slice: the public renderer still answers `404` for its own
  icon requests (5 medium findings, unchanged). Slice 2's finding stands: creating a draft page emits
  no event, so a fresh draft reaches the index only on a publish or a reindex.
- Next: REQ-032 stays in progress — **slice 4** (natural-language resolution: `POST
  /command-center/resolve` on ai-hub, the intent preview card, confidence threshold with "Did you
  mean", `Edit as search`, timeout fallback); wave 1 then moves to REQ-007 (analytics + the real
  dashboard).

## 2026-09-26 — REQ-032 · slice 4 · the palette reads what is typed into it

- **A phrase becomes a structure, checked against the platform's own tables.** `crates/search/src/intent.rs`
  reads one phrase into the vocabulary the platform really has — the domain maps through the provider
  registry, a command is only ever a registry entry whose own words the phrase covered, filters are the
  ones the index supports, and confidence is *computed* from what was recognised, so the same words
  always read the same way. An unmapped domain stays a search and says so; a command the caller cannot
  run is dropped and the words search instead. 13 walks, no database.
- **The model is asked first and checked afterwards.** `POST /api/v1/command-center/resolve` (guard
  `search.read`) answers the intent, a preview line, `runnable`, the destinations, the alternatives and
  where the reading came from — and executes nothing. A connected model gets a six-second bound and a
  closed vocabulary; its answer is *normalised* (unknown command, unknown provider, out-of-range sort or
  count dropped, not trusted) and an unusable one leaves the grammar's reading standing with
  `degraded: true`. Only model readings are audited (`command.resolve`: the interpreted intent, never a
  row of content). The endpoint answers `search_route` (the editable search) beside `route` (where a
  runnable reading lands), because a reading the caller may not run still has an editable shape.
- **The card is a proposal beside the results, not a gate in front of them.** It sits above the list
  like the confirmation card and is deliberately not an arrow-key row (every row the arrows reach must
  be a screen); its controls are real buttons, ≥44px on touch. `Run` shows only for a runnable reading,
  and a reading of an action command opens the platform's *own* confirmation card, so a command that
  asks first asks here too. `Edit as search` always exists, the request aborts when a newer keystroke
  overtakes it, and a failing reader offers a retry. Low confidence ("zzqqxx", 55%) carries no Run at
  all — only alternatives.
- Proof: `cargo test --workspace` → **490 passed, 0 failed** (27 new) · `cargo clippy --workspace
  --all-targets -- -D warnings` → clean · `pnpm typecheck && pnpm build` → 2/2 · `bash scripts/qa/run.sh`
  → 97 clicks, 117 screenshots, **0 high findings**, **0 vision issues** (`qa-artifacts/20260926-194131`;
  the walkthrough's new steps record `parsedIntent: true · offersRun: false · ranNothingYet: true` and
  `Edit as search` landing on `/search?q=tickets+Mehmet&sort=newest`) · `scripts/qa/probe-command-resolve.cjs`
  → **47/47** (including a connected model that never answers degrading in **6.4 s** with its audit entry,
  and the card at 390×844) · the four older palette probes re-run clean.
- Next: **wave 1 moves to REQ-007** (analytics + the real dashboard). REQ-032 is closed; carried
  forward, not caused by this slice: the public renderer's own icon 404s (5 medium findings), and
  `page.created` is still not emitted by `POST /api/v1/pages` (REQ-002 follow-up).

## 2026-09-26 — REQ-007 · slice 1 · the platform starts counting

- **One beacon becomes rows, and the decision comes first.** `POST /api/v1/public/analytics/collect`
  is a public write path, so what protects it is what a public write path *can* be protected by:
  a 64 KB body cap, a per-site-and-caller budget (429 named `rate_limited`, tested by spending the
  whole budget), a site resolved exactly as the renderer resolves it (`?site=`, then the
  forwarded host, then the installation's only site) — and a collector that decides **before** it
  writes. Tracking switched off, `DNT: 1`, `Sec-GPC: 1`, a crawler user agent, an excluded path or
  address and the site's own sample rate are all evaluated ahead of the first write, which is why a
  dropped beacon leaves no trace at all: not a visit, not an event, not even the day's salt row.
  What it does leave is a counter — the day's `filtered` bucket, the one metric the rollup is
  forbidden to recompute (the bucket delete is narrowed with `metric = any(...)`).
- **A hash instead of a person.** The visitor identifier is `sha256(site, day-salt, address, user
  agent)`; the salt is 32 random bytes per UTC day in `analytics_salts` and nothing else is stored.
  The tests read the row and find a 64-hex hash and `ip_prefix = null`. With `anonymize_ip` switched
  off the row keeps the truncated network only — `203.0.113.0/24`, `2001:db8:1::/48` — the widths
  the request documents, asserted in the walk and in the module's own unit tests.
- **A bucket run is a delete and a rewrite, not an increment.** `rollup_day`/`rollup_hour` recompute
  every metric/dimension pair from the raw rows inside one transaction, so running a bucket twice
  writes the same numbers: the walk snapshots `analytics_daily` before and after the second run and
  compares them row for row. High-cardinality dimensions are capped at fifty values per bucket with
  the tail folded into `(other)`, sorted by count and then by value so two runs write the same order.
- **The settings screen's validation is the API's validation.** One `validate()` in the module is
  what both the endpoint and (from slice 2) the panel call; `retention_days = 3` answers
  `invalid_analytics_settings` and the message *names the field*, `mode` is closed to the two
  documented values, and excluded paths and addresses are checked line by line. Reading a site's
  settings and snippet is `analytics.read`; changing them is `analytics.settings.manage`; both
  resolve the site through the caller's own organization — a reader of the second organization gets
  `cross_organization`, and the platform Owner is the caller who may reach across.
- **`modules/` exists now.** REQ-007 called for `modules/analytics` while every previous feature
  landed under `crates/`; docs/04-MONOREPO.md reserves `modules/` for features a customer can carry,
  so the workspace gained `modules/*` and this is its first member (`omnion-module-analytics`).
  The schema landed as **0015** — 0012–0014 went to search and the command centre while this request
  waited, and the "next free slot at build time" rule in the request is what that means.
- **Two deliberate reads of the same promise.** The tracker (`apps/web/public/analytics.js`) stops
  before it makes a request when the browser reports DNT or GPC, and the collector enforces the same
  rules again on the server: a client-side promise is not a promise. Engagement rides as a
  `page_engagement` **event** rather than a second pageview beacon, because a second pageview for the
  same page would double-count it.
- **Proof:** `cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast` → **524 passed, 0 failed** (analytics: 22 module
  units + 6 integration walks; every other suite unchanged and green) · `cargo clippy --workspace
  --all-targets -- -D warnings` → clean · `pnpm typecheck && pnpm build` → 2/2 · `bash
  scripts/qa/run.sh` → 105 clicks, 117 screenshots, **0 high findings**, **0 vision issues**
  (`qa-artifacts/20260926-202816`; the 5 medium findings are the public renderer's own icon 404s,
  carried forward). This slice ships no screen, so the walkthrough inventory is unchanged.
- **Fresh-database proof:** `create database omnion_fresh_check` + `omnion migrate` →
  `applying 14 pending migration(s): 1 … 15` → `database is up to date (14 of 14 migrations
  applied)`, and the database holds 11 `analytics_*` tables with zero settings rows (an empty
  installation has no sites to seed for). The check database was dropped afterwards.
- Carried forward, not caused by this slice: the public renderer's icon 404s (5 medium), and
  `page.created` is still not emitted by `POST /api/v1/pages` (REQ-002 follow-up).
- Next: REQ-007 stays in progress — **slice 2** (overview + the six report screens over these
  rollups, the shared date-range toolbar, filters, drawers and CSV export, plus the walkthrough
  gaining the ten `/analytics` routes with a synthetic beacon batch).

## 2026-09-26 — REQ-007 · slice 2 · the numbers come back out

- **The read side is one module, and it is honest about where a number comes from.** `reports.rs`
  answers the overview, the page report, sources, audience, events, downloads and forms. A range
  inside the site's retention window is read from the **raw rows** — that is where *distinct
  visitors across a period* is a real number rather than a sum of per-day counts — and a range
  that reaches past retention falls back to the daily rollups, marking the answer `exact: false`
  so the screen can say so. Series buckets are addressed by an offset from the range start rather
  than by a truncated timestamp: `date_trunc` follows the connection's time zone, and a report
  that shifts by an hour depending on who asks is worse than no report.
- **A report's SQL and its binds cannot drift.** `Narrowing` writes only the clauses a report
  actually applies and numbers each placeholder from how many values are already bound. The first
  draft had the failure modes this prevents: a no-op placeholder for a filter the sources report
  cannot use, and a `limit` that was bound three times out of four (the QA of the module's own
  tests caught the first as a red assertion, the second as a 500).
- **Where a filter cannot apply is a fact about the data.** A visit has no path of its own — its
  pageviews do — so the path filter on a visit-scoped report narrows through an `exists` over that
  visit's pageviews; a page report narrows the path on the pageview itself. The screens and the
  export share one query, so the CSV holds exactly the rows the table showed, and the row count
  rides in `x-export-rows` because a silently truncated file lies.
- **The collector now stores the country an edge reported.** Cloudflare's `CF-IPCountry` and its
  two siblings are read on the beacon; the platform still never geolocates an address itself, and
  the edges' own "unknown" placeholders (`XX`, `T1`) are refused — a country that is not a country
  would show up in the audience report as a place.
- **Seven screens, one toolbar.** The report screens live behind a shared shell whose state is the
  URL (range presets, two pickers, comparison, granularity, export, refresh with a last-updated
  caption, and the spec's keyboard: `d`, `c`, `r`, `e`, `g`+`o|p|s|a`). The overview's empty state
  hands over the tracking snippet instead of an empty chart; a comparison against a period with no
  traffic says "no comparison" rather than drawing a delta against zero; below `lg` every table
  becomes a card list (one layout in the DOM, chosen by a media query, so a hook names exactly one
  element).
- **Three defects the QA pass found, and the fix for each.** (1) The date pickers let a range end
  before it starts, so every screen asked the API for a range it must refuse — 28 of the pass's 29
  errors; moving one end now drags the other. (2) The country filter sent whatever was typed and
  let the API be the first line of defence; the field validates as a two-letter code, marks itself
  `aria-invalid` and says so under the input. (3) A click-through harness looked up an element on a
  page that was already being replaced by a client-side navigation; the pass now settles after each
  click and records the click error itself, and the wizard's step loop waits for its own step to
  move instead of submitting twice.
- **Proof:** `cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast` → **541 passed, 0 failed** (the analytics
  module's 36 units + the suite's 9 integration walks, three of them new: the seeded overview and
  its comparison, the filtered/sorted/paged page report with its CSV, and the dimension reports
  with an empty site answering zeroes) · `cargo clippy` clean · `pnpm typecheck && pnpm build` →
  2/2 · `bash scripts/qa/run.sh` → 328 clicks, 331 screenshots, **0 high findings**, **0 vision
  issues** (`qa-artifacts/20260926-220408`). The depth pass reads the analytics section end to end:
  a synthetic batch of four visitors (two devices, three countries, one download, one form with its
  start, one custom event with a value) spread over thirty days, the 7-day range with the
  comparison on, a page drawer, a real CSV download (`omnion-analytics-pages-2026-09-20..2026-09-26.csv`,
  2 rows) and the empty state of a filter that cannot match.

  unchanged), and `page.created` is still not emitted by `POST /api/v1/pages` (REQ-002 follow-up).
- Next: **REQ-007 slice 3** — goal CRUD with steps, hit recording from pageviews/events/downloads
  and the server-side conversions, the funnel endpoint and screen (`/analytics/goals`), and
  realtime (`/analytics/realtime` + its SSE counters). Slice 4 then closes the privacy operations
  (retention purge with its audit row, visitor erasure, the "what we store" table and the
  `/analytics/settings` screen).

## REQ-007 slice 3 — goals, funnels and realtime (2026-09-26)

- **Goals are the platform's definition of a conversion, and the recorder is ordered and
  deduplicated.** `modules/analytics/src/goals.rs` validates a goal (a name, one to five steps, and
  a match that means something per kind), stores the funnel in one transaction, and mirrors the
  last step in the goal's own row. `record_facts` only ever moves a visitor to the *earliest missing*
  step, so a later step cannot be reached before an earlier one — and one beacon can carry a visitor
  several steps because a batch can hold several facts. Every write is an `on conflict do nothing`
  on the unique `(goal, visitor, step)` key, and only the hits that were actually written are
  reported, which is what lets the API emit `analytics.goal_reached` exactly once per conversion.
- **A funnel counts a step as *reached* by the visitor whose furthest position inside the range is
  that step or beyond.** That is what keeps counts monotonically non-increasing when a visitor's
  earlier step happened before the window; counting hits at position *p* would let step two exceed
  step one. A goal shortened after the fact folds a furthest position beyond the funnel into the
  last step instead of dropping it.
- **Realtime reads raw rows and nothing else.** `modules/analytics/src/realtime.rs` answers the last
  five and thirty minutes (visitors, pageviews, events, goal hits, current pages, event feed), the
  API hands it over as a snapshot and as server-sent snapshots every five seconds, and a per-site
  cap of eight live streams is enforced by a guard that travels inside the stream so a dropped
  connection frees its slot. The first pass of this slice failed here: `analytics_events.value` is
  `numeric`, the feed decoded it as a float, and every realtime request answered 500 — the cast
  (`value::float8`) and a test that gives an event a value closed it (the assertion failed before
  the fix, passes after).
- **Two screens, one section.** `/analytics/goals` (list with conversions, rates, last hit, switch,
  edit, delete; an editor with an ordered step list, per-step validation and a live funnel with
  drop-offs) and `/analytics/realtime` (two windows, current pages, event feed; the pill turns to
  `Paused` and the stream closes while the tab is hidden). Reading is `analytics.read`, writing is
  `analytics.goals.manage`; a `PATCH` merges so a switch never rewrites the match it did not show.
- **The QA harness learned one thing about itself.** Every screen drops its in-flight fetches when
  the URL state changes and the realtime stream ends with the tab, so a browser-cancelled request
  (`net::ERR_ABORTED`) is now *counted* (`abortedRequests`) instead of reported as a high finding —
  24 of the first pass's 159 high findings were exactly that, and none of them was a defect.
- **Proof:** `cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast` → **556 passed, 0 failed** (the new walks: a
  three-step funnel recording 3·2·1 with drop-offs and a deduplicated re-send, and realtime counting
  a beacon with an event value) · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` → clean ·
  `pnpm typecheck && pnpm build` → 2/2 · `bash scripts/qa/run.sh` → 404 clicks, 406 screenshots,
  **0 high findings**, **0 vision issues** (`qa-artifacts/20260926-231356`). The walkthrough creates
  a two-step goal through the editor (and is refused when a step has no match), completes it with a
  real beacon, reads the funnel back (`1` · `1`, conversions `1`), measures the beacon-to-counter
  latency at **18 ms**, and reads the live realtime screen (pill `live`, five-minute counter `1`,
  two current pages, four feed events).
- Carried forward, not caused by this slice: the public renderer's icon 404s (5 medium findings,
  unchanged), and `page.created` is still not emitted by `POST /api/v1/pages` (REQ-002 follow-up).
- Next: **REQ-007 slice 4** — retention purge with its audit row, visitor erasure, the exclusions
  and sampling half of the settings screen, the "what we store" table, `/analytics/settings`, and
  the `analytics.traffic_spike` / `analytics.retention_purged` / `analytics.erasure_completed`
  events.

## REQ-007 slice 4 — privacy operations, the settings screen, the spike watch (2026-09-27)

- **The privacy promises became database operations, in one readable file.**
  `modules/analytics/src/privacy.rs` holds the retention purge (one site, whole days, the audit row
  written inside the same transaction as the deletions, pageviews counted before the visit delete
  would take them along), the visitor erasure (visits, pageviews, events and goal hits of one
  handle — idempotent, because an erasure that fails on a retry is a compliance problem of its
  own) and `STORED_FIELDS`, the "what we store" table the screen renders from the same source as
  the schema. `detect_spike` and `spike_recorded` live beside them: the hour that just closed
  against the trailing week's median, announced once, with the guard reading the events themselves
  rather than a counter a restart would lose.
- **The salts are the one shared table**, so the prune is the one statement not scoped by a site —
  and it uses the *longest* retention any site still asks for, because one site's seven-day window
  must never delete a salt another site's window still covers. A salt is only read while it is the
  current day; the row is dead weight past every window.
- **API and events.** `POST /analytics/purge` and `DELETE /analytics/visitors/{hash}` sit behind
  `analytics.settings.manage` — the permission that decides how long data lives is not the one that
  reads it — and both record their fact on the bus (`analytics.retention_purged`,
  `analytics.erasure_completed`) with the audit id and the counts, never an address. The settings
  payload grew `purge_cutoff`, `last_purge` and `storage`, so the screen never guesses any of the
  three. The rollup worker announces `analytics.traffic_spike` once per completed hour.
- **The screen** (`/analytics/settings`): tracking, privacy, exclusions with a glob preview that
  reads each pattern back, the snippet with its site key and copy control, the data section — the
  cutoff named *before* the purge runs, the erasure requiring the handle typed twice — and the
  storage table. Field validation mirrors the server's of the same field. The section shell learned
  a toolbar-less mode: a screen with no date range and nothing to export renders neither.
- **The walkthrough learned `data-qa-guard`.** The generic click pass fills every field with a
  sample value; on this screen a sample value in the erasure field would be a refused request (a
  high finding), not a click. A screen now declares which controls its own depth pass drives, and
  the pass skips them — recorded as `deferred-settings`.
- **One finding, fixed in the tick.** The first pass flagged four `role="switch"` buttons with no
  accessible name (the `<label for>` that names them visually does not name them to the harness);
  `aria-label` closed it, and the pass was re-run to prove the fix rather than to claim it.
- **Proof:** `cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast` → **562 passed, 0 failed** (the new walks: a
  purge that removes exactly the stale rows on both sides of a seven-day cutoff and leaves another
  site alone, an erasure that removes five rows of one handle on its own site and zero of another's,
  and both facts delivered to a real HTTP receiver; plus a flat-week fixture where forty visitors
  against a median of five is a spike and an hour nobody spiked is not) · `cargo clippy
  --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` → clean · `pnpm typecheck && pnpm build` → 2/2 ·
  `bash scripts/qa/run.sh` → 436 clicks, 433 screenshots, **0 high findings**, **0 vision issues**
  (`qa-artifacts/20260927-002830`). The settings pass on the populated QA database: tracking saved
  and read back after a reload, a retention of 3 refused with the field named, the purge named its
  cutoff (`2026-09-20`) and took the rows past it from 1 to 0, a real handle was erased with its
  rows counted before (1) and after (0), and the storage table rendered ten rows with three
  marked personal.
- Carried forward, not caused by this slice: the public renderer's icon 404s (5 medium findings,
  unchanged), and `page.created` is still not emitted by `POST /api/v1/pages` (REQ-002 follow-up).
- Next: **REQ-006 (IAM)** — the next wave-1 item: user, role and permission screens plus sessions
  and devices.

## 2026-09-27 · REQ-006 slice 1 — role depth (migration 0011, the matrix, versions)

- **The migration carries the whole request.** `database/migrations/0011_iam_advanced.sql` adds the
  role side this slice uses (`role_versions`) and the rest of the model the later slices land on:
  the `users`/`sessions` extensions, devices, MFA factors and recovery codes, groups, service
  accounts and their keys, ABAC policies and versions, the security-policy document, sign-in
  attempts, sign-in providers, permission requests, provisioning tokens and their log. The
  `role_bindings` move to subjects and the wider scope ladder is expand-then-contract: the new
  columns arrive beside `user_id`, are backfilled from it, and a `before insert` trigger fills
  `subject_id` for writers that still insert the old shape. Verified twice — applied to a scratch
  database (fresh) and to the populated development database (backfill + the policy seed read
  back).
- **Role depth in the crate.** `crates/permissions` gained `update_role`, `delete_role` (refusing
  a role that still carries live bindings), `duplicate_role`, `ancestors`/`children`, one
  validation function that refuses a cycle and a chain past eight levels in either direction
  (called by both `create_role` and `update_role`), and `replace_role_permissions` — the atomic
  matrix save with `expected_version`, the applied diff and a recorded version. The new
  `versions` module appends and reads `role_versions` and computes diffs; the diff itself is pure
  and unit-tested.
- **The API** grew `/iam/roles/{id}` (detail with entries, chain, children, member count),
  `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `POST /duplicate`, `POST /preview`, `GET /versions`, `GET /members`, and the
  matrix save now answers with the diff it applied. Refusals carry field-level codes
  (`role_inheritance_cycle`, `role_inheritance_depth`, `role_has_bindings`,
  `role_version_conflict`, `invalid_entries`). The catalogue gained the IAM family the later
  slices guard their routes with.
- **The panel**: `/settings/iam/roles` and `/settings/iam/roles/{id}` — the tri-state matrix
  (category accordion, per-category counts, grant/deny/inherit-all, filter, diff preview, sticky
  Save/Discard) and the Members, Inherited by and History tabs, where each version shows its diff.
  The navigation gained one entry, and the write controls declare `data-qa-guard` so the generic
  click pass never fires them.
- **Two defects the QA pass found that no unit test could.** (1) The role list answered platform
  roles plus one organization's, but a platform account (the QA owner has no primary
  organization) never named one — so a role the panel had just created for a tenant vanished from
  its own list, and the create form posted without a tenant and answered `400`. `GET /iam/roles`
  now takes `?organization_id=`, the panel gives platform accounts a tenant picker, and the
  create/duplicate forms send it. (2) An empty name was refused by the server, which made every
  mistyped save a `400` in the console: the editor now refuses it in the field (the API keeps and
  proves its own refusal in the integration walk).
- **One carried-forward fix**: the analytics settings storage table forced a 720px minimum inside
  a 560px card, and the vision pass read the overflow as clipped text. `DataTable` now takes a
  `minWidthClass`, the storage table fits its card, and a measurement proves it (table 558 ≤ panel
  560, no clipped cells).
- **Proof:** `cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast` → **572 passed, 0 failed** across 48 suites
  (exit 0; the new walk is `apps/api/tests/iam.rs::role_depth_lifecycle_is_proven_end_to_end` —
  create → set → duplicate → delete-while-unbound, the cycle/self/depth refusals, the atomic
  refusal that stores nothing, the stale-version conflict, the history diffs, precedence through
  the guard, and the server's own refusal of an empty name) · `cargo clippy --workspace
  --all-targets -- -D warnings` → clean · `pnpm typecheck && pnpm build` → 2/2 (the route table
  lists both new screens) · `bash scripts/qa/run.sh` → **507 clicks, 493 screenshots, 0 high
  findings**, 2 vision issues (both on the analytics charts, medium/low) —
  `qa-artifacts/20260927-022655`. The depth pass in the browser: create (version 0) → the matrix
  cell cycled allow → deny → inherit → allow → diff preview (`1 added`) → save (version 1) →
  reload and the cell is still set → history shows the version with its diff → Members/Inherited
  by → an empty name refused in the field → edit saved → duplicate (the copy opens with the set) →
  the copy deleted with its notice.
- Carried forward, not caused by this slice: the public renderer's icon 404s (5 medium findings,
  unchanged).
- Next: **REQ-006 slice 2** — the users screen, bindings at every scope level with expiry, groups,
  service accounts and their keys, effective permissions and the RBAC simulator.

## 2026-09-27 · REQ-006 slice 2 — subjects, scopes and the simulator

- **A binding belongs to a subject now, not to an account.** `Subject::{User, Group,
  ServiceAccount}` plus the whole scope ladder (global → organization → site → department → module →
  resource) and `ResourceContext`, which carries the organization, site, department, module and
  path a question is asked in. `matching.rs` turns a binding's resource glob (`/blog/*`) into a
  matcher; `groups.rs` keeps membership a row rather than a second role table;
  `service_accounts.rs` issues keys as prefix + hash (secret returned once, revocable per key).
  Migration `0016_iam_subjects.sql` completes the expand-then-contract move: `user_id` becomes
  optional and liveness is re-keyed on the subject plus the resource the binding names, so
  `/blog/*` and `/legal/*` can both carry a binding.
- **Seeding was an insert, and an insert is not a reconciliation.** Only the Owner role followed
  the catalogue (`seed.rs` even documented it as policy), so a key added after an installation was
  seeded never reached the role that declares it: measured on the development database,
  Administrator held **32 of 72** keys while Owner held all of them. The symptom is not a hole, it
  is an unexplainable `403` — the same role works in a fresh QA database and refuses in production.
  Every base role is reconciled on boot now: declared keys are inserted, a row whose effect drifted
  is repaired to allow, and a key the code dropped is pruned. `seed::ensure` is called on every
  write path in the test walk to prove it, against the count `report.permissions` reports.
- **The refusal names its decision source.** A `403 permission_denied` carries `details`: the
  permission, the `reason` (`missing_permission` / `explicit_deny`), the `source` role with its
  `via`, the context and how many bindings were consulted. The verdict comes from `simulate.rs` —
  the *same* resolution the simulator screen shows and the REQ demands one decision path — so the
  body and the panel cannot drift.
- **A machine identity is a caller, with its own ladder.** `require_or_machine` lets a route accept
  a session cookie or a service-account key: the cookie wins (a signed-in person is never mistaken
  for a machine), a key authenticates over `Bearer` only where the route opts in, and a key can
  never start a session. `api.rs` resolves both to `ApiCaller`, so a handler reads one value.
- **Panel.** `/settings/iam` (overview with accounts, expiring bindings, recent activity),
  `/settings/iam/users` (filters, create, detail with bindings and groups), `/settings/iam/groups`
  (directory plus members panel), `/settings/iam/service-accounts` (create, key shown once, revoke)
  and `/settings/iam/simulator` (subject, resource path, action → verdict card with every binding
  it consulted, decisive first).
- **Proof.** `cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast` → **589 passed, 0 failed** across 48 suites
  (exit 0) · `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` → clean · `cargo fmt --check`
  → clean · `pnpm typecheck && pnpm build` → 2/2, the admin route table lists all eight identity
  screens · `bash scripts/qa/run.sh` → **612 clicks, 628 screenshots, 0 high findings**, 5 medium
  (all carried forward: the public renderer's icon 404s), 3 vision issues (1 medium + 2 low, both
  on the analytics realtime card's raw snapshot ids — pre-existing) — `qa-artifacts/20260927-041657`.
- **The browser pass drives the slice, not just the routes.** `iam-subjects` in
  `scripts/qa/walkthrough.cjs`: overview cards (6) → create `qa-subject@example.com` → open the
  account → attach the role at organization scope → effective permissions (72 granted) → a
  resource binding on `/blog/*` → simulator `ALLOWED` with its source → `/blog/hello-world`
  `ALLOWED` vs `/legal/terms` `DENIED` with one `out_of_scope` binding → groups panel with one
  member and one role → service account with its key shown once (`omsa_…`) → revoke → the role's
  members tab answers with 3 subject rows.
- **The first pass's high finding was the harness, and it is fixed.** The wizard clicked a button
  that was still working ("Creating…"), which submitted a step twice; the platform refused the
  duplicate — correctly — and that refusal landed while the next step's form was being filled, so
  the organization POST went out with an empty name. The walkthrough waits the busy state out now
  (`5d1a376`), and `--only=wizard` re-checks the flow on its own: on a freshly reset database it
  reports `WIZARD_ONBOARDING_FAILURES=0`. The second full pass confirms it (3 console errors, 2
  failed requests — the carried-forward 404s only).
- **Two small defects the pass caught in this slice, fixed and re-measured on the live panel:**
  the three user-list filters had no accessible name (`85cfa84` → `aria-label`s; re-check reports
  zero unlabelled inputs) and the groups row's delete control was a 12px grey glyph the vision
  review read as a smudge (`9155b0d` → caution colour, 14px icon, `aria-label` "Delete QA Team";
  re-check: 32×24 button, `rgb(138,93,22)`).
- Carried forward, not caused by this slice: the public renderer's icon 404s (5 medium), the
  analytics realtime card's raw snapshot ids (1 medium + 2 low vision).
- Next: **REQ-006 slice 3** — sessions, devices, MFA and the security policy (revoke + sign-out-all,
  idle/absolute lifetime from the policy row, lockout per account and per IP, IP lists, TOTP and
  passkey enrolment with step-up, recovery codes). The walkthrough's denial case should use an
  account with no bindings so the artifact shows a `DENIED` verdict card as well.

## 2026-09-27 — REQ-006 slice 3a: the security policy, sessions, devices and TOTP

- **The slice.** Migration `0017` adds `sessions.step_up_at`, a live-session index and
  `mfa_challenges`. `crates/identity` gained five modules: `totp` (RFC 6238/4226 over HMAC-SHA1
  with the RFC's own vectors, Base32, `otpauth://`), `secrets` (encrypt-then-MAC envelopes for
  stored secrets, key from `OMNION_MFA_KEY`), `security` (the policy document, its ranges as
  field-level refusals, a CIDR matcher), `devices` (fingerprint, first/last seen, trust window)
  and `mfa` (two-step TOTP enrolment, ten single-use recovery codes hashed and consumed by a
  conditional update). `signin` runs the order a sign-in should: address lists → lockout →
  password → factor, with every attempt recorded in `sign_in_attempts`. Sessions now take idle,
  absolute and concurrent lifetimes from the policy row — never from a constant.
- **Dangerous operations demand a fresh step-up** (`POST /auth/step-up`: the caller's own
  password or an enrolled code, ten minutes): resetting factors, removing a confirmed factor and
  issuing a service-account key answer `403 step_up_required`, and the panel parks the refused
  action behind a prompt that retries it. Forgetting a device also ends its live sessions.
- **Panel**: `/settings/iam/security` (five policy tabs, ranges on the field, the diff a save
  applied), `/settings/iam/sessions` (state badges from the resolver's own values, filters,
  revoke, sign-out-all, cards below `lg`), `/settings/iam/devices` (trust window, forget) and the
  user detail's **Second factors** tab (enrolment with the secret shown once, confirmation +
  recovery codes, remove, reset).
- **Proof.** `cargo test --workspace` → **614 tests, 0 failures (exit 0)**; identity's own suite grew to 52 (TOTP against the RFC 4226/6238 vectors, envelopes, CIDR matching, hashing). The slice walk
  (`apps/api/tests/iam.rs::sessions_devices_mfa_and_the_security_policy_are_proven_end_to_end`)
  proves the whole slice over HTTP in 15.6s: the policy save with its diff, a range refusal and an
  unusable network each naming their field, a lockout that triggers at the configured threshold
  (the correct password is refused while locked), a denied address refused with the *correct*
  password, an allowlist narrowing, the per-address failure count, the idle window proven twice
  (refused at five minutes, accepted at two hours), a revoke that ends a session on its next
  request, `sign-out-all`, the concurrent cap retiring the oldest, the device registry with its
  trust window, TOTP enrolment + confirmation + a challenge a code completes, a recovery code
  spent exactly once, `step_up_required` on MFA reset and key issuance, and the audit trail
  carrying every one of those actions. `pnpm typecheck && pnpm build` → 2/2, the admin route
  table lists the three new screens.
- **QA pass** `qa-artifacts/20260927-055804`: **727 clicks, 750 screenshots, 0 high findings** (5 medium, all the carried-forward public renderer 404s), vision review 1 medium (the analytics realtime card's raw snapshot ids, pre-existing) and 0 vision failures. The new pass `iam-security-depth` recorded 14 steps, all of them green: policy refused in the field, saved with its diff, the address list refusing an unusable network, the session list with two rows and a real revoke, the filtered list, the device registry trusted and cleared, and the MFA enrolment dialog opened (secret + `otpauth://` shown) and cancelled.
- **What the first pass found (fixed in this tick).** Two high findings, both mine: the policy
  screen sent an invalid network to the API instead of refusing it on the field (now validated in
  the browser too — the API's own refusal stays pinned by the integration walk), and a *platform*
  account saw an empty session and device list because the screens defaulted to the first tenant
  while those accounts carry no organization (both now default to "all organizations", with a
  picker to narrow). The walkthrough's first run also showed the two list screens returning zero
  rows for the same reason — that is how the defect was found.
- Carried forward, not caused by this slice: the public renderer's icon 404s (5 medium).
- Next: **REQ-006 slice 3b** — WebAuthn/passkeys (the ceremony: CBOR parsing, COSE key handling
  and signature verification), then slice 4 (enterprise sign-in, SCIM, ABAC policy builder,
  approvals, the safety invariants). Slice 3b needs a crypto dependency (`p256`/`ed25519-dalek` +
  a CBOR reader) that the workspace does not carry yet.
## 2026-09-27 — REQ-006 · slice 3b · WebAuthn passkeys

- **What.** Passkeys are real: `crates/identity/src/webauthn/` carries a small CBOR reader
  (`cbor.rs`), the COSE credential key (`cose.rs`, ES256 + EdDSA) and both ceremonies (`mod.rs`).
  Registration checks the ceremony type, the challenge this server issued, the origin it serves,
  the relying-party hash, a present user, the attested COSE key and — for a `packed` statement
  without a certificate chain — its self signature; an assertion verifies
  `authenticatorData || SHA-256(clientDataJSON)` with the stored key and refuses a signature
  counter that does not move forward. Migration `0018_webauthn.sql` adds `webauthn_challenges`
  (single-use, purpose-scoped, one live per account+purpose). The API gained
  `/api/v1/auth/webauthn/register/begin|complete`, `/passkeys`, `/passkeys/{id}` and
  `/authenticate/begin|complete`, with `auth::start_session` shared by both sign-in paths; the
  panel gained the passkeys section in the user detail's Second factors tab and the second step of
  the sign-in screen (code, recovery code, **Use a passkey**).
- **The documented loopback exception.** A WebAuthn relying-party id must be a domain, so the QA
  stack (served on `127.0.0.1`) cannot run a ceremony at all; the server binds credentials to
  `OMNION_WEBAUTHN_RP_ID` (default `localhost`) and `OriginPolicy` accepts a loopback origin from
  any port unless `OMNION_WEBAUTHN_ALLOW_LOOPBACK=false`. That rule has its own unit test and the
  browser pass relies on it — a test that silently skips is not evidence.
- **Proof (Rust).** `cargo test --workspace` → **630 tests, 0 failures** (exit 0; +16 on the last
  tick). The ceremony units cover ES256 and EdDSA round trips, a verified and a broken packed self
  attestation, and every refusal; `apps/api/tests/webauthn.rs::a_passkey_enrols_and_signs_in_end_to_end`
  drives the slice over the real router with a software authenticator (options → registration →
  duplicate credential `409` → foreign origin `400 webauthn_refused` → passkey list → password
  sign-in answering `mfa_required` → assertion options → assertion opening a session whose auth
  methods carry `webauthn` and whose counter moved → replayed counter refused → step-up-gated
  removal → password-only sign-in again).
- **Proof (web).** `pnpm typecheck && pnpm build` → 2/2 (`@omnion/admin`, `@omnion/web`).
- **Proof (QA).** `bash scripts/qa/run.sh` → `qa-artifacts/20260927-084333`: **727 clicks, 754
  screenshots, 5 findings (0 high** — the five carried-forward public-renderer 404s**)**, vision
  review 0 issues / 0 failures, and `Refusals provoked on purpose — 2` (the step-up gate, with its
  reason). The run before it read **7 findings (2 high)**: the pass's own designed step-up refusal
  (403 + its console line) was being counted as a defect, so the harness gained `expectRefusal` —
  a single-use, index-bounded allowance a pass registers immediately before a deliberate act, with
  what it swallows reported instead of hidden. The pass still asserts the refusal happened (the
  prompt appeared) and the retry succeeded (the row is gone). The new
  `iam-passkeys` pass enrols a passkey with a Chrome **virtual authenticator** on
  `http://localhost:<port>` (the loopback exception), shows the row, has the sign-in answer the
  factor step, completes it with the passkey, removes it through the step-up prompt and proves the
  account is password-only again — the first run of the pass was red (`rows: 0`), the debug probe
  named the cause (an IP literal is not a valid relying-party id), and the fix is in the pass.
- **Next.** REQ-006 slice 4 — enterprise sign-in (OIDC/OAuth2/SAML with JIT + claim mapping), SCIM
  provisioning, the ABAC policy builder + dry run, permission requests/approvals and the safety
  invariants.

## 2026-09-27 — REQ-006 · slice 4a · the ABAC policy engine, the builder and the safety invariants

- **What.** Policies are real and they change decisions. `crates/policy-engine` is the pure half —
  a condition tree (`all`/`any`/`not` plus leaves of attribute → operator → value), seven operators
  (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `in`, `starts_with`, `contains`), `*` wildcard target patterns, the
  missing-attribute-reads-as-null rule and the decision rule (highest priority first, equal
  priorities resolve to deny, disabled decides nothing). `crates/permissions` gained `policies`
  (CRUD + a version row on every save + the attribute merge + the overlay) and `invariants` (the
  two refusals that protect a last owner and the caller's own last privileged binding).
  `evaluate::authorize_subject` — the one decision path the guard, the effective-permissions screen
  and the simulator share — now resolves RBAC and then hands the answer to `policies::apply`, so a
  deny policy takes away what RBAC granted, an allow policy grants what RBAC never gave, and the
  `403` reports the policy by name in `details.source.policy`. The API gained
  `/api/v1/iam/policies` (+ `/{id}`, `/versions`, `/test`) where the dry run writes nothing and
  accepts an unsaved draft; the panel gained `/settings/iam/policies` — condition rows with
  ALL/ANY and NOT, a JSON view for trees the rows cannot express, the THEN block, the dry run with
  its highlighted leaves and the version history.
- **The invariants count scope classes, not "the organization".** The first attempt counted every
  live privileged binding whose `organization_id` matched — and the platform Owner's binding is
  GLOBAL (`seed::bind_owner`), so on a shared development database the count matched every global
  owner binding in the database and the refusal never fired. Fixed by keying the count on the
  binding's own class: an organization-scoped binding is defended by its organization
  (`organization_id = $org`), a global one by the other global ones (`scope_type = 'global'`), and
  the self-lockout rule is checked first because it is the actionable sentence when both apply.
- **Proof (Rust).** `cargo test --workspace` → **653 tests, 0 failures** (exit 0; +23 on this
  slice: 14 policy-engine units, 6 overlay/attribute/validation units, 2 invariant units, and
  `apps/api/tests/iam_policy.rs::abac_policies_and_the_safety_invariants_are_proven_end_to_end`,
  which drives the slice over the real router: the member without `iam.policies.read` is refused,
  the deny policy removes `users.read` from the Owner (403, `reason=policy_denied`, the policy
  named in `details.source.policy`, and the simulator agreeing), the allow policy grants the same
  permission to a member whose RBAC set provably does not carry it, priority 900 takes it back,
  disabling the deny returns the allow, the history reads three versions back, the dry run reports
  a satisfied leaf with its resolved value (and the opposite when the path does not match), the
  four `invalid_policy` refusals answer `400`, and the invariants answer `self_lockout` then
  `last_owner_binding` then let an ordinary revocation through — with the audit trail and the
  `iam.policy_changed` events read back).
- **Proof (web).** `pnpm typecheck && pnpm build` → 2/2 (`@omnion/admin`, `@omnion/web`), with
  `/settings/iam/policies` in the route table.
- **Proof (QA).** `bash scripts/qa/run.sh` → `qa-artifacts/20260927-112459`: **772 clicks, 803
  screenshots, 5 findings (0 high** — the five carried-forward public-renderer 404s**)**, vision
  review 0 issues / 0 failures, `Refusals provoked on purpose — 2`. The pass's new `iam-policies`
  run reads: builder filled (1 target chip, 1 condition row) → dry run `APPLIES (deny)` with 1
  matched leaf → saved (0 → 1 rows, 2 versions) → delete armed then gone, back to the start state →
  the out-of-range priority refused in the field. The route is walked on desktop and mobile
  (`page-iam-policies`, `page-iam-policy-{editor,test,history,refusal}`, `mobile-iam-policies`).
- **Two defects the QA pass caught, both fixed in this tick.** (1) The condition rows took their
  ids from a module-level counter, so the server rendered them with different ids than the client —
  React refused to patch the tree (a hydration error, 20 console errors, plus the dev overlay's own
  Reload/Back buttons that the walk then timed out on). The row the editor opens with now carries a
  constant id and only rows the reader adds use a counter (they exist on the client alone); the same
  pass had flagged four inputs without a label, and the five standalone controls gained
  `aria-label`s. (2) The generic clicker types junk into every textarea, and the JSON view's parse
  escaped out of a render (`SyntaxError`); both JSON paths now refuse in the field — the draft
  falls back to the rows and says the JSON does not parse, the toggle keeps the reader in the JSON
  view with the reason. An adversarial probe (junk in the attributes, junk in the JSON view, Test
  in both states, save) reports zero console errors. A second full pass after the fixes: 0 high.
- **Next.** REQ-006 slice 4b — enterprise sign-in (OIDC/OAuth2/SAML providers with JIT provisioning
  and claim → role mapping), SCIM 2.0 provisioning with its sync log, and permission
  requests/approvals as time-boxed bindings.

## 2026-09-27 — REQ-006 slice 4b-1 · Permission requests → approvals, and SCIM 2.0 provisioning

- **What shipped.** `crates/identity` gained the SCIM provisioning token store (`mc_…`-style
  secrets hashed at rest, mint/verify, revocation, and the sync log the panel reads);
  `crates/permissions` gained `approvals` — a request asks for ONE permission with a reason and a
  window, a decision turns it into a **time-boxed binding** (`grant-<permission>`, priority 100,
  `expires_at`), so an approved request grants exactly inside its window and expires on its own with
  nobody acting. The API serves `GET/POST /iam/approval-requests`, `POST /{id}/approve|reject`,
  `GET/POST /iam/provisioning/tokens`, `DELETE /iam/provisioning/tokens/{id}` and the SCIM 2.0
  surface (`GET /scim/v2/Users`, `POST /scim/v2/Users`, `PATCH /scim/v2/Users/{id}`,
  `GET /scim/v2/ServiceProviderConfig`) behind a bearer token, with `iam.approval.requested|
  approved|rejected` events and audit rows. The panel gained `/settings/iam/approvals` (inbox with
  a request form, approve/reject with a note, the window chip, the decided tabs) and
  `/settings/iam/provisioning` (token minting with the secret shown once, revocation, and the sync
  log with created/updated/deactivated rows).
- **Proof (Rust).** `cargo test --workspace` → **660 tests, 0 failures** (exit 0, 54 suites; +7 on
  this slice: `apps/api/tests/iam_approvals.rs::an_approved_request_grants_only_inside_its_window`
  — the granted window is moved into the past and the permission leaves with nobody acting, the
  member cannot read the inbox, decide, or read the user list after a refusal, and the audit trail
  carries the three events — and `apps/api/tests/scim.rs::a_scim_round_trip_provisions_and_logs`,
  which creates → patches → deactivates a user over the real router and reads the sync log back).
  **Run it against a database of your own:** the shared development database now carries migrations
  0019/0020 applied by the concurrent sibling clones (branches for later REQs), so every suite that
  migrates dies with `Migration(VersionMissing(19))`. `docker exec omnion-postgres psql -U omnion
  -d postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE omnion_tickbuild"` then
  `OMNION_DATABASE_URL=…/omnion_tickbuild cargo test --workspace` is green; the failures are
  cross-branch interference, not the tree.
- **Proof (web).** `pnpm typecheck && pnpm build` → exit 0, both apps.
- **Proof (QA).** `bash scripts/qa/run.sh` (stack `b`: ports 18090/3110/3240, database
  `omnion_qa_b`) → `qa-artifacts/20260927-175102`: **29 pages, 855 clicks, 72 field fills, 887
  screenshots, 5 findings (0 high** · 5 medium · 0 low — the five carried-forward
  public-renderer root 404s; the renderer correctly answers “nothing published here” for a site
  with no page at its root and the pass still records it)**, vision review 3 items on the analytics
  screens (medium ×2: the analytics-settings snippet block clips its last line; low ×1: the legend
  names a `Page views` series the chart does not draw — REQ-007 territory, untouched here). The new
  passes read: **iam-approvals** — request created (0 → 1 pending) → approved (window chip
  `expires 9/27/2026, 7:04:07 PM · 30m`) → rejected (1 in the decided tab) → an unshaped
  permission key refused in the field; **iam-provisioning** — token minted (1 → 2, secret shown
  once) → SCIM round trip (create `201` active, patch `200` deactivated, listed once) → sync log (2
  rows: one created, one deactivated, with its sentence) → revoked (2 revoked, the next SCIM call
  `401`). Both screens are walked on desktop and mobile.
- **The pass caught its own machinery, and that was the finding to fix.** Run `20260927-163614`
  reported 13 high hydration console errors across six screens (`/search`, `/settings/search`,
  `/settings/iam`, `/users`, `/groups`, `/sessions`) and a media `503`. Root cause of the hydration
  reports: the pass stamps `data-qa-idx` on every element and clicks the moment a document is
  ready — inside `next dev`'s hydration window; five out-of-band Playwright probes could not
  reproduce a mismatch without the pass's own writes, the markup involved carries no data, and the
  same pages were clean in every earlier pass. The apps now announce hydration
  (`apps/admin/components/app-ready.tsx` sets `data-app-ready="1"` from an effect) and every
  navigation in `scripts/qa/walkthrough.cjs` waits for that mark before anything touches the page —
  the next pass: **0 hydration reports, 0 high findings**. Two more run-time lessons: the media
  `503` did not survive re-checking (30 consecutive list requests plus the page's own loads, all
  `200` — a transient of the disposable stack), and the web checks had been reading port `3220`,
  which on this box belongs to an unrelated application (the published-page check read a stranger's
  login screen). The stack now names its own ports (`QA_WEB_PORT=3240`), its own database and its
  own report file, and the published sample reads back as `200 · “QA Sample Page · QA Site” ·
  heading “QA Sample Page” · Revision 2`.
- **Next.** REQ-006 slice **4b-2** — enterprise sign-in: OIDC/OAuth2 and SAML providers per
  organization with JIT provisioning and claim → role mapping, local sign-in staying available.
  That closes REQ-006; then the next wave-1 item in BUILD-PLAN order.

## 2026-09-27 — REQ-125 · slice 1 · the secret key hierarchy, the rotation ceremony and its screen

- **What.** The key ring (docs/requests/REQ-125, slice 1). `crates/secrets` is the pure half: an
  installation root key is never stored by the platform, only *wrapped* by an operator-supplied
  key-encryption key (`OMNION_KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, or the file it names), and every sealed
  version records the `key_id` that sealed it. `crates/secrets/src/store.rs` is the database
  half, `apps/api/src/routes/secrets.rs` the surface
  (`GET /secrets/root-key`, `POST /secrets/root-key/rotate`, the job's `GET`/`pause`/`resume`),
  and `apps/api/src/secrets_runner.rs` the background walk. The panel gained
  `/secrets/root-key`: the self-check, the ring, a three-step rotation wizard and a real
  progress counter.
- **The rule the design rests on.** Unsealing reads the version's *own* `key_id`, never the
  active key — so a version the walk has not reached keeps resolving on the retired key, and a
  rotation is an online ceremony rather than a maintenance window. The ceremony is ordered so a
  crash cannot lose data: the replacement is generated and written *wrapped* while the old key
  is still active, the old one steps down to `retiring`, the new one goes `active`, and only
  then is the job row created. A flip whose job row was lost is repaired **on the read of the
  ring** (`recover_missing_job`), not on a timer. `start_rotation` refuses outright when the
  seal self-check is unhealthy, and `rewrap` fails closed — a wrong operator key can never
  overwrite a stored envelope.
- **Proof (Rust).** `cargo test --workspace` → **681 tests, 0 failures** (exit 0; +26 unit tests
  in `omnion-secrets` and one end-to-end walk,
  `apps/api/tests/secret_key_ring.rs::the_key_ring_and_its_rotation_are_proven_end_to_end`, which
  unseals *the same stored envelope* before, during and after the walk, proves a wrong operator
  key is refused with the ring left intact, drives pause/resume to a completed job, and greps
  every response body for the fixture value and for `wrapped_key`/`seal_checksum`).
- **Proof (web).** `pnpm typecheck && pnpm build` → 2/2 (`@omnion/admin`, `@omnion/web`), with
  `/secrets/root-key` in the route table and a Secrets entry in the navigation.
- **Proof (QA).** `QA_STACK=w6 … bash scripts/qa/run.sh` → see the entry appended below once the
  pass finishes; the new `secrets-root-key` run drives the sealed wizard, Escape, a real
  rotation, the counter, pause and resume, and asserts the document carries no envelope.
- **Three findings this tick cost time on, worth not repeating.** (1) Postgres `count(*)` is
  `int8`; sqlx will not coerce it into an `i32`, so every count in this feature is cast in SQL
  (`count(*)::int`). (2) `permissions_key_format` forbids underscores inside a key segment, so
  `secrets.deploy_keys.read` is listed by the catalogue and rejected by the database — it is
  `secrets.deploykeys.read`. (3) **The parallel waves all opened a `0019` migration and they all
  share the `omnion` development database**, so `cargo test` failed with `VersionMismatch(19)`
  on a migration this writer never ran; each worktree needs its own database (`omnion_w6_dev`,
  following w5's precedent) or the suites cannot run at all in parallel.
- **Blocker cleared, and a warning for the other six writers.** `/mnt/apopic` hit **100% (0 bytes
  free)** mid-tick: the seven worktrees' cargo `target/` directories plus docker-data fill the
  60 GB volume, and a full disk silently truncated `scripts/qa/walkthrough.cjs` to **0 bytes**
  during a write (restored with `git checkout --`). The QA pass then died with `ENOSPC` while
  writing screenshots. Reclaimed by deleting this worktree's own regenerable `target/` (7.8 GB
  back); no other writer's files were touched. A periodic `target/` prune is needed before the
  waves can all run at once.

- **QA gate: blocked by the shared volume, not by this change.** Four attempts, all failing the
  same way and none of them a defect in the new screen. The evidence: with the volume at
  `%100` the admin's Turbopack cache write fails
  (`failed to write ... .next/dev/cache/turbopack/.../00000031.sst: No space left on device`),
  which leaves Chromium crashing on the *overview* page — before the walkthrough ever reaches
  `/secrets/root-key`. A standalone Playwright probe of the same w6 stack
  (`/login` → 200, `/` → 307, no crash) passes, which is what separates "the box is out of room"
  from "the screen is broken". The one run that did get past the reset did reach the new route
  and interact with it (`page: secrets-root-key → interact: 24 elements`) before the disk failed
  on the next screenshot.
  `/mnt/apopic` is a 60 GB volume shared by the seven worktrees; the cargo `target/` directories
  alone were 2.3 GB (w4) + 6.3 GB (w3) + 8.6 GB (w5) + 9.6 GB (w7) at the time. Deleting this
  worktree's own regenerable `target/` frees 2.6–7.8 GB, but the other writers rebuild
  immediately and the volume is back at `%100` within minutes. **A `cargo clean` sweep across the
  idle worktrees, or a larger volume, is needed before the seven waves can run their QA gates
  concurrently.** Until then slice 1 ships with its Rust and web proofs green and the QA box
  honestly unticked.
- **Next.** REQ-125 slice 2 — typed credential profiles with their per-kind validators, the slot
  assignment model and its resolver, `/secrets/credentials` and `/secrets/slots`.


## 2026-09-27 — REQ-006 slice 4b-2 (part 1) · the enterprise sign-in core

- **What shipped.** `crates/identity/src/sso/` — the whole protocol layer of enterprise sign-in,
  before any HTTP: **provider rows** (`providers.rs`, the `auth_providers` table of `0011` finally
  read and written; a client secret never enters a row, it lives behind `secret_ref`), **the
  challenge** (`challenges.rs`; the `state` every round trip is bound to, SHA-256 at rest, single
  use, ten minutes, and *burned rather than retried* once somebody is guessing at it),
  **OIDC/OAuth2** (`oidc.rs`; discovery, the PKCE challenge, RS256 verification and the
  registered-claim checks `exp`/`iat`/`nbf`/`aud`/`iss`/`nonce`), **SAML 2.0** (`saml.rs`; the
  assertion reader and its two independent signature checks) and **the protocol-neutral identity**
  (`claims.rs`; one `Identity` shape every flow reduces to, plus the claim → role rules).
  `database/migrations/0021_iam_sso.sql` adds the two tables a *running* sign-in needs —
  `sso_challenges` and `auth_provider_events` — and nothing else: the provider row itself already
  existed in `0011`. The number is **0021**, not 0019, because the sibling waves own 0019 (`w2`
  `cms_blocks`) and 0020 (`w3` `automation_depth`); migration numbers are claimed per wave, and
  three unclaimed worktrees have already collided on 0019.
- **Proof (Rust).** `cargo test -p omnion-identity --lib` → **103 tests, 0 failures** (33 new on
  this part). The cryptography is tested against *real* cryptography, not against itself: the
  RS256 and SAML tests generate a 2048-bit key, sign, and require the module's verifier to accept
  the genuine signature and reject a tampered one.
- **The SAML signature check is two checks, and the second one is the one that matters.** XML
  Signature binds a document to a key in two independent steps, and my first implementation only
  did the first: verifying the RSA signature over `<ds:SignedInfo>`. The tamper test — change an
  e-mail inside a validly signed assertion, keep the original signature — **passed**. The
  `DigestValue` is what ties the `SignedInfo` to the assertion under the *enveloped transform* (the
  element with its own `<ds:Signature>` removed); with it, the tampered document is refused
  because the bytes changed. Skipping either check leaves a hole: the digest alone lets anyone
  rewrite a claim, the signature alone signs the algorithm but not the document.
- **Four more real bugs the tests caught, each a genuine defect rather than a test artefact.**
  (1) A repeated `<saml:Attribute Name="groups">` was being dropped, so a directory that sends a
  multi-valued attribute as several elements lost half a group membership and under-granted a
  role. (2) `rsplit(':')` on `<saml:Assertion xmlns:saml="urn:…:assertion">` returns the
  *attribute value*, because a colon inside an attribute looks exactly like a namespace separator —
  the qualified name has to be located before the prefix is dropped. (3) A closing tag is spelled
  with the prefix the document used, so searching for `</Assertion>` found nothing. (4)
  `<ds:SignatureMethod Algorithm="…"/>` has no text; the algorithm is its attribute, and reading it
  as text fails silently three frames deep.
- **The disk is a blocker, and it is an environment problem rather than a code one.**
  `/mnt/apopic` is one 60 GB loop image shared by **eight** worktrees' `target/` directories, and it
  hit **100% full twice during this tick** — each time inside a `write_file`, which then failed with
  "No space left on device". The reclamation is deliberately conservative: only **derived**
  artifacts were removed (`target/debug/{deps,incremental,build}` and the incremental caches) and
  only in worktrees with no live `cargo`/`rustc` and no running pm2 process; no source file, no
  branch, no sibling's running server was touched. The siblings rebuild within minutes and refill
  the volume, so the headroom is temporary. **Owner action:** the box needs more room, or the
  unclaimed `omnion-w4`…`omnion-w7` worktrees (≈12 GB of cargo target plus 454 MB of
  `node_modules` each) should be pruned — no wave owns them yet.
- **Next.** The same slice's remaining part: the API surface (`GET/POST /iam/providers`,
  `PATCH/DELETE /iam/providers/{id}`, `POST /iam/providers/{id}/test` for the discovery check, and
  the public `GET /api/v1/auth/sso/{slug}/start` + `POST …/callback` pair), JIT provisioning and the
  claim → role binding on sign-in, the `iam.signin.*` events, the `/settings/iam/authentication`
  panel screen, the `apps/api/tests/sso.rs` integration walk (sign in against a stub provider → JIT
  account → mapped role → expired challenge refused) and the `iam-authentication` QA pass. Then
  `cargo test --workspace`, `pnpm typecheck && pnpm build` and `bash scripts/qa/run.sh` close the
  REQ.

## 2026-09-27 · omnion-wave6 · REQ-125 slice 2 — typed credentials + credential slots

**What.** A credential profile now extends a secret with a `kind`
(`api_key`, `oauth_token`, `smtp_account`, `payment_key`, `ssh_key`) and structured **non-secret**
fields; the value stays in `secret_versions.envelope` and never travels through a profile row.
`credential_slots` binds a slot (`ai.provider`, `smtp`, `payments.stripe`, `storage.s3`,
`ssh.release`, `identity.ldap`) for a scope to a primary and an optional fallback secret, so a
consumer resolves through the slot and swapping a credential is a slot update. The resolver
records who resolved last, which lets the editor name the workload a removal would affect. Two
screens ship with it: `/secrets/credentials` (kind, validation chip, last validated, next
validation) and `/secrets/slots` (scope, slot, primary, fallback, state, last resolved).

**Proof.**

```text
cargo test -p omnion-secrets --quiet                        → 31 passed, 0 failed
cargo test -p omnion-api --test secret_credentials --quiet   → 1 passed, 0 failed
pnpm typecheck                                               → 2/2 packages successful
QA_STACK=w6 … bash scripts/qa/run.sh                        → see below
```

**Next.** Slice 3 — leases, loopback redemption, the helper subcommand and deployment keys.

### What this tick taught

- **A 500 with the column name in the message is a spec/code disagreement, not a typo.** The
  credential list selected `c.validate_interval_days` while the shipped migration defines
  `validation_interval_days`. The failure only appeared once the test pointed at the *private*
  wave database, because the shared dev database had never applied this wave's `0019`.
- **A green 403 can be a green test.** The cross-tenant assertion expected `200` for a foreign
  organization while the route (correctly, per the spec) refuses scope escalation with `403`. The
  assertion was the defect: when a route and a test disagree, the route is the spec.
- **Seven parallel writers make migration version numbers collide.** `0019` is now claimed by
  this wave, `wave2-cms` and `wave3-automation`, and `0021` by `main` and `wave4`. sqlx keys
  applied migrations on the version number *and* the file checksum, so a shared database applies
  whichever branch reached it first and every other branch then fails with
  `Migration(VersionMismatch(19))`. **Every wave needs its own private database** — this wave
  runs against `omnion_w6_dev`; pointing a test at the shared `omnion` database tests another
  wave's migration set, not this code.
- **The disk pressure of the previous tick is a shared, moving target.** `/mnt/apopic` went from
  100% to 71% mid-tick when a sibling loop ran its own reclamation. This worktree's `target/` is
  a symlink into `/dev/shm`, so a full volume cannot corrupt *this* build — that one decision
  (taken earlier) is what kept the gates runnable through the incident.

### Two environment findings from the QA pass

- **The concurrency slot deadlocked every pass (fixed here, `0f50e80`).** `run.sh` takes its slot
  through `$(… | tail -n 1)`, and the background holder that keeps the place alive inherited that
  pipe. The substitution therefore waited for an EOF the holder would never send: the pass hung
  silently with only `place taken` in the log. Worse, two places whose owner had died stayed taken
  until `WAIT+900`, so later passes were queued out with no way to recover. The holder now runs
  with stdout closed and a dead owner's place is reclaimed at once. Proof: with both places
  occupied (one live, one dead) the script returns a pid in **0.2 s** instead of hanging.
- **The walkthrough has no role, so no permission-guarded screen is actually exercised.** A fresh
  QA database has **zero rows in `role_bindings`** (verified: `select count(*)` → 0) while the
  catalogue holds all 8 `secrets.*` keys. The walkthrough signs in as the account the wizard
  creates, and that account carries no role, so `/secrets/credentials` and `/secrets/slots`
  correctly render `this action requires the "secrets.read" permission`. The denial is *correct
  behaviour* — the screens refused exactly what they should — but it means the populated table,
  the editor drawer and the validator chip have **not** been seen in a browser yet, and this tick
  does not claim otherwise. The same cause explains the `console-error` shots that also appear on
  `ai`, `analytics` and the `iam-*` screens: it is one harness gap, not per-screen defects.
  **Owner action:** the QA pass needs to bind the owner role after the wizard (`seed::bind_owner`
  is what the API integration tests use) before any permission-guarded screen counts as proven.

### Browser proof for the two screens (private w6 stack)

The walkthrough could not show the populated screens because the QA account carries no role, so
the two were driven directly against the same private stack with an owner-bound account
(`qa-sample@omnion.test`, org `qa-org`, owner role bound), which is what the panel reads.

```text
POST /api/v1/secrets/{id}/credential   payment_key → 201 · ssh_key → 201
POST /api/v1/secrets/{id}/credential   on the `file` provider → 400 secret_read_only   (spec: read-only providers are not writable)
PUT  /api/v1/credential-slots/…/smtp   → 200
PUT  same secret as primary+fallback   → 409 credential_slot_self_reference
GET  /credential-slots/{scope}/{slot}/resolve/qa-org → 200 "The primary answered."
/secrets/credentials  → 3 rows, chips valid / invalid / unknown, no value on screen, 0 console errors
/secrets/slots        → 6 slots, 2 assigned with primary+fallback, 0 console errors
```

- **A missing `#[serde(with = "time::serde::rfc3339")]` renders as garbage, not as a compile error.**
  `SlotView.last_resolved_at` is a bare `time::OffsetDateTime`, so serde emitted the raw
  `time` tuple — `[2026, 270, 21, 45, 41, 906321000, 0, 0, 0]` — and the panel printed the first
  number as if it were a year. Every sibling route already carried the attribute; five fields in
  this file did not. Found by reading the rendered screen, not by a failing test: nothing in the
  suite asserted the wire format. `93b713a` fixes all five.
- **A check constraint is documentation.** Building the fixture failed twice before the rows went
  in: `secrets_bridge_locator_check` (a non-`local` provider needs a locator) and
  `secrets_scope_type_check` (`organization`/`global` only). Both are the schema refusing an
  inconsistent row, which is exactly what they exist for.
- **A session cookie is bound to one origin.** The panel talks to the API on :18085 while the
  browser is on :3105, so a curl-minted cookie must be injected into the browser context; logging
  in through the form alone bounces back to `/login` in a scripted pass.

## 2026-09-28 — REQ-006 slice 4b-2 (parts 2–3) · the API, the screen and the integration walk

- **What shipped.** The HTTP half of enterprise sign-in, the screen that drives it, and the walk
  that proves both. **`61ef619`** — `crates/identity/src/sso/provisioning.rs` (JIT: match on the
  stored subject index first, the address second, `JIT_PASSWORD_MARKER` in place of a password,
  and a *refusal* rather than a silent row when provisioning is off); the identity HTTP client
  grows the two calls the `code` flow needs; `/api/v1/iam/providers` (list, connect, patch, remove,
  `…/test` for the discovery check, `…/events` for the sign-in log); and `/api/v1/auth/sso`
  (the public `providers` list, `start`, the generated SAML panel page, and the `callback` that
  answers both a `code` query and a posted assertion). **`f599c3c`** — `/settings/iam/authentication`,
  the nav entry, the API client and the `iam-authentication` pass in `scripts/qa/walkthrough.cjs`.
  **`apps/api/tests/sso.rs`** — the integration walk.
- **Proof.** `cargo test -p omnion-identity --lib` → **107 tests, 0 failures**. `cargo test -p
  omnion-api --lib` → **97 tests, 0 failures**. `cargo test -p omnion-api --test sso` → **1 walk,
  0 failures** over the real router: the management surface (401 without a session, an empty
  organization listing no provider and three kinds), a provider created **switched off with JIT
  off**, the secret answered as a *name* plus a boolean (`secret_present: false` for a variable
  this process does not define) and no `client_secret` field anywhere in the payload, a bad
  `secret_ref` refused with `details.field = secret_ref`, an unreadable role mapping refused at save
  time, the discovery test answering `200 {status: "failed", detail: …}` for an unreachable host, a
  disabled provider `404 provider_disabled` **and written to the sign-in log**, JIT refusing then
  provisioning the same identity to `Created` with the marker in `password_hash` and the subject
  indexed under `sso_subjects`, the second sign-in `Existing` on the same account, a deactivated
  account staying deactivated, the event log readable over HTTP, removal taking the log with it
  (`on delete cascade`), and an ambiguous host answered `501 organization_required` rather than
  guessed.
- **The two design decisions this tick actually settled.** (1) **A public sign-in has to resolve
  its own organization.** My first version took "the installation's only organization", which is
  right for a first-run install and *silently wrong* for a second tenant — a sign-in link for one
  organization could complete against another. The walk caught it by creating a second organization.
  It now follows the same rule the public content surface uses: the browser's own host answers for
  its site, and a site belongs to an organization; several organizations and an unknown host is an
  honest `501` naming the fix. (2) **A refusal is a fact, not a silence.** A disabled provider
  refusing to start wrote nothing, so an operator who switched a provider off and then wondered
  "is anybody still trying to sign in with it?" had no way to find out. `live_provider` now writes
  the `auth_provider_events` row before refusing.
- **Two test-authoring bugs the walk caught in itself, both worth naming.** A group claim is only
  read when the provider *names* one, so a test provider with `group_claim: None` proved nothing
  about groups — the fixture was wrong, not the code. And a test fixture that registers a globally
  unique host has to clear a stale one first, or the second run fails on the first run's leftovers.
- **The disk is still the constraint, and it is an environment problem rather than a code one.**
  `/mnt/apopic` (one 60 GB loop image shared by eight worktrees' `target/`) fell to **3.1 GB free**
  during this tick. Reclamation stayed conservative and derived-only: `target/debug/{deps,
  incremental,build}` in the **unclaimed** `omnion-w5` and `omnion-w7` worktrees, neither of which
  had a live `cargo`/`rustc`; no source, no branch, no running process touched. That returned
  17 GB. **Owner action:** the box needs more room, or the unclaimed `omnion-w4`…`omnion-w7`
  worktrees should be pruned — no wave owns them yet.
- **A note on where the walk runs.** The shared dev database `omnion` has migration **19** applied
  from a sibling branch that `main` does not have, so `db.migrate()` refuses with
  `VersionMissing(19)` and every integration test that migrates fails there. CI starts a clean
  database and is unaffected. The walk was proven against a fresh `omnion_sso_test` database.
  **Owner action:** either reconcile the 0019 slot between the waves, or point the local
  integration runs at a per-branch database.
- **Next.** The one thing the walk deliberately does not fake: a **full round trip against a live
  OIDC/SAML provider**. That needs a local stub identity server the walk can point at — discovery
  document, JWKS, token endpoint and a signed ID token for OIDC; a signed assertion with the
  enveloped digest for SAML — so the `code` exchange, the RS256 verification, the PKCE binding and
  the claim → role mapping are all proven end to end rather than one layer at a time. Then
  `cargo test --workspace`, `pnpm typecheck && pnpm build` and `bash scripts/qa/run.sh` close the
  REQ.

## 2026-09-28 — REQ-010 slice 1, verified end to end (six defects found)

- **What this tick was.** Slice 1 (folders + browser + trash) was already written and its boxes
  were already ticked, but nothing had ever *executed* the folder move, the trash listing or a
  filtered listing against a real database — the walk that asserts the audit rows for
  `media.folder_moved` and `media.folder_deleted` never performed a move or a delete. This tick
  made the walk real and then fixed what it found.
- **Six defects, none of them visible to the layer that owned them.**
  1. **Every filtered listing was broken.** The clause was built as a string containing `$n` *and*
     the value was pushed as a bind, so the statement read `folder_id = $2$2` and PostgreSQL
     answered "syntax error at or near $2". An unfiltered listing worked, which is exactly why no
     earlier test saw it. `Filter::push` now writes clause and value together, so a placeholder can
     only exist where the value beside it was pushed.
  2. **`make_interval(days => $2)` with a bound parameter.** PostgreSQL cannot infer the remaining
     arguments of a named-argument function, so it picked a `numeric` overload and sqlx failed to
     decode. Replaced with `$2::bigint * interval '1 day'`, which is unambiguous.
  3. **`sum(size_bytes)` returns `numeric`.** sqlx will not decode `numeric` into an `i64`, so the
     trash summary answered 500. Cast back to `bigint`.
  4. **`ORDER BY` inside an `UPDATE`.** PostgreSQL has no such clause; the folder move 500'd on
     every call. The ordering premise it encoded was wrong anyway — one `UPDATE` evaluates every
     row against the pre-update snapshot, so no ordering is needed.
  5. **A folder move self-parented the folder.** The parent was resolved by the moved folder's *own*
     new path, so `parent_id` became the folder itself on every move, and the first move of a
     top-level folder hit `media_folders_root_name_idx`. The parent is now resolved by the
     *parent's* path.
  6. **An omitted `parent_id` meant "move to the root"** although the body documents "omitted keeps
     the current one" — so renaming a nested folder silently relocated it to the top. A no-op move
     is also no longer reported as `folder_cycle`, which is a cycle where there is none.
- **Two more honest answers.** A `folder_not_empty` refusal now has a tested counterpart (an empty
  folder deletes, and a deleted folder is a `404` by id so a stale deep link names what is missing),
  and a move to where a folder already is is a no-op.
- **Proof.** `cargo test -p omnion-media --lib` → **25 tests, 0 failures** (three new: every filter
  and every combination refuses to write a placeholder twice, the subtree clause binds its folder
  once per mention, the tag clause compares from the placeholder side). `cargo test -p omnion-api
  --lib` → **105 tests, 0 failures**. `cargo test -p omnion-api --test media` against
  `omnion_test_main` → **8 walks, 0 failures**, over the real router: the tree refused without a
  session and to an account with no media permission, a site created after the migration still
  materialises one root, folders create/rename/move/re-parent/delete with the subtree rewrite read
  back out of the row, a cycle and a duplicate sibling name and a blank name each refused by name,
  a file moves between folders without its storage key changing, a filter narrows the listing and
  the total follows, a `like` wildcard in a search term is treated as text, the trash lists the
  deleted file with a real countdown, restore returns it to its folder, purge removes the bytes as
  well as the row, and every privileged step left an audit row. `pnpm typecheck` green. clippy adds
  no new warning.
- **Environment note.** The shared dev database `omnion` still carries a sibling's migration 19,
  so the walks run against `omnion_test_main`. `/mnt/apopic` was at 98% again; reclaiming
  `target/debug/incremental` in this worktree returned 2.9 GB.
- **Next.** Slice 2 — preview, metadata, versions. The version table already exists; the version
  history, the preview pipeline and the file detail screen do not.

## 2026-09-28 — REQ-125 slice 4: the audit trail, and the two defects that made it a lie

- **What this tick was.** Slice 4 of the secrets depth request: the access trail, the four
  anomaly detectors with a persisting acknowledge, and the metadata-only SIEM feed. The
  interrupted tick had left the migration, the crate module and the four route handlers
  uncommitted. They compiled and the crate's 53 tests were green, so they were committed as
  their own unit before anything was built on top of them — a WIP proven green is worth
  banking before the next tick touches the same tree.
- **The trail is the platform's `audit_log`, not a second ledger.** Migration 0032 adds four
  nullable columns (`request_id`, `lease_id`, `deployment_key_id`, `pipeline`) to the existing
  append-only table and the secrets surface reads *that*. REQ-037, which would have added a
  secrets-specific access log, is still queued; a second table would have left it a parallel
  structure to reconcile. The request states the same rule about redaction — "two
  implementations drift" — and the same argument applies to the ledger.
- **Two defects, and both of them were invisible to the layer that owned them.**
  1. **The request id was readable in the trail and unjoinable in it.** The migration added
     the column, but `NewAuditEntry` had no setter for any of the four — so all four were
     structurally guaranteed to be null forever. The redemption paths had been dutifully
     putting the id into the *metadata JSON*: readable, and useless, because the screen filters
     on `audit_log.request_id`. An operator holding a refusal's request id could never land on
     the row explaining it, which is the entire reason the id exists. Four additive setters,
     the columns added to the insert and the returning list, and the lease rows moved off the
     blob. Setters, not constructor arguments: null is the honest value for the overwhelming
     majority of actions in the platform, and four `None`s on every call site in the codebase
     is a worse trade than one opt-in call where it matters.
  2. **The screen silently dropped every lease row.** It filtered on an enumerated list of six
     action names; the handlers write fifteen distinct actions, and *one of the six* —
     `secret.lease` — is written by nothing at all. So `secret.lease.issued`,
     `secret.lease.revoked`, `secret.credential.typed`, `secret.credential.validated`,
     `secret.root_key.rewrap_paused/resumed` and every `deployment_key.*` row were being
     recorded correctly and displayed as nothing. Nothing anywhere disagreed: the counts
     matched, the query returned 200, and the evidence was simply invisible. A list of names
     is a list that rots *invisibly*; a namespace prefix cannot. The filter is now
     `action like 'secret.%' or action like 'deployment\_key.%'`, and the filter chips the
     screen offers are derived from the rows actually present rather than from a hand-written
     list — which is what "no dead controls" asks for in the first place.
- **The anomaly detectors are advisory and the code says so rather than implying otherwise.**
  Four patterns (off-hours reveal, reveal burst, new address, principal that never held the
  secret) as *pure functions* over counts the store already has, so the rule is testable
  without a database and the query is testable without a rule. The request's optional hard
  rule ("production reveals require a second approver") exists as a column that defaults off
  and is read by nobody: a rule that can lock an incident responder out at the worst moment
  costs more than an unread advisory row. Off-hours is measured in the installation's local
  hour, not UTC — a detector on UTC calls a 22:00 reveal in İğdır business hours and a 03:00
  automated rotation a night.
- **The SIEM feed is a projection with an allowlist, not a redaction pass over a row.** An
  allowlist cannot leak by omission, because a column that is not on it is not on the output;
  a redaction pass can, because the day someone adds a column to `audit_log` the pass has
  never heard of it. The integration test asserts the allowlist itself, not just the absence
  of today's fields.
- **Proof so far.** `cargo test -p omnion-audit -p omnion-secrets -p omnion-api --lib` →
  **170 tests, 0 failures** (2 + 53 + 115). `pnpm typecheck` green. `apps/api/tests/secret_audit.rs`
  → **1 walk, 0 failures** over the real router against `omnion_test_w6`, asserting: the trail
  is readable and every action in it is offered as a filter chip; the issue and the revoke both
  land joined by `lease_id`, with an actor, an address and a request id; a scripted 03:00
  reveal raises an `advisory` off-hours flag that joins back to the request that raised it; the
  acknowledge persists across a re-read and a *second* acknowledge answers
  `already_acknowledged` rather than claiming a change; the NDJSON export contains neither
  the fixture value nor a masked fragment, and every line is one object carrying the join key
  and no `metadata`/`envelope`; an action outside the namespaces narrows to nothing rather
  than widening; a malformed `since` is refused by name (`invalid_since`).
- **The three failures the test found on the way, all of them mine.** The suite first 403'd
  on its own screen because `secrets.audit` is deliberately *not* `secrets.read` and the suite
  skipped the IAM seed; then it collided with its own residue on `secrets_name_scope_idx`; then
  a lease write was correctly refused with `organization_required` because a write needs a named
  scope and a read does not. The second one is the general lesson — a suite that passes on a
  virgin database and fails on a warm one is not proving the behaviour, it is proving the
  migration order.
- **Next.** The walkthrough pass for `/secrets/audit` is written (route registered, depth pass
  added, wired into the run). A QA stack run on the private ports is the remaining gate before
  the last acceptance box can be ticked and REQ-125 closes.
- **Environment note.** Six worktrees compiled concurrently on this box: load average 223, 32 G
  of RAM with ~1 G available, `/mnt/apopic` at 96% (2.4 G free). The test compile itself is
  fine; the wall-clock cost is contention, not a failure.

## wave6 · REQ-125 · the interrupted tick's gate, run honestly (2026-09-28, iter 5)

- **What.** The tree carried an uncommitted fix from an interrupted tick, and the last acceptance
  box needed the private-stack walkthrough. So this tick ran the gate rather than reading the
  previous report — and the walk found four defects, three of them real ones a green suite had been
  sitting next to.
- **Four defects, in the order the walk hit them.**
  1. `acknowledge_anomaly` selected `count(*)::int` into an `i64` decoder. Postgres reported
     `INT4` against a Rust `INT8` expectation and the acknowledge answered **500** — on a
     perfectly healthy database, after writing the row and computing the right count. The cast is
     the right instinct for an `i32` and the wrong one here; the siblings in the same file cast
     because theirs are `i32`.
  2. `?action=one` was a **400**. A `Vec` in a query struct only deserializes the repeated form,
     so the panel's own multi-select worked and every other caller — a link, a bookmark, a
     hand-typed URL, and the walk's own click — did not. A filter only its own client can satisfy
     is not a filter. `one_or_many` takes both; a unit test covers the single, repeated and absent
     cases.
  3. The acknowledge wrote **no `request_id`**, so a flag an operator cleared could not be joined
     to from the trail. This is the same structurally-dead-column mistake slice 4 already fixed
     once, in a different action — which is the argument for asserting the column, not the idea of
     the column.
  4. `json!` renders an `OffsetDateTime` as a nine-element array, so the stored lease metadata —
     and the SIEM export built from it — carried `[2026, 271, 6, 14, 57, …]` where a timestamp
     belongs.
- **And the test itself was green for the wrong reason, twice.** `oneshot` bypasses the connect
  layer `main.rs` installs, so `ClientAddress` saw no extension, every row was written with a null
  `ip_address` — and the suite passed on that. It was asserting the row carried a peer address
  while proving the opposite. The "no masked fragment" check grepped for
  `wrapping-key-id-not-a-value`, a key id the suite itself wrote into `metadata` on purpose: a
  stand-in that could never fail. Both now assert the real thing (the peer `ConnectInfo`, the hint
  `hint_for` computes). The address assertion asserts the *host*, not the string — the column is
  `inet`, so a bare IPv4 reads back `198.51.100.7/32`, and pinning the rendering would break the
  day the column type changes.
- **Proof.** `cargo test -p omnion-api --lib --test secret_audit` → **117 + 1 passed, 0 failed**
  (the walk asserts: the trail is readable and every action in it is offered as a filter chip; the
  issue and revoke join by `lease_id` with actor, address and request id; a scripted 03:00 reveal
  raises an advisory that joins back; the acknowledge persists and a second answers
  `already_acknowledged`; the NDJSON carries neither the value nor its hint, and every line is one
  allowlisted object). `cargo test -p omnion-secrets -p omnion-audit --lib` → **55 passed**.
  `pnpm typecheck` green.
- **The box stays open.** The walkthrough has not been re-run on the private stack since these four
  fixes, so the last acceptance line is unticked rather than ticked on a re-read of a report that
  predates them. The 247 high findings in the previous run were all `400`s on this wave's own
  screens; two of the three causes are fixed here and the third is the report itself being stale.
- **Environment.** `/mnt/apopic` was at 99% and a `cargo` incremental write died with
  `No such file or directory` — the `target/` symlink into `/dev/shm` had been replaced by a real
  directory at some point, so the build was writing to the full loop image. Moved it back
  (`/dev/shm/omnion-w6-target`, 3.7 G) and the volume went 99% → 88%. **Check `readlink -f target`
  at tick start** — a symlink that silently became a directory is a slow disk failure, not a
  loud one.
- **Next.** The private-stack walkthrough on 18085/3105/3205. Green, and REQ-125 closes; then
  REQ-126 (observability stack).

## 2026-09-28 — REQ-010 slice 2, a version history that does not rewrite the past

- **What this tick was.** Slice 1 gave the library a file system. This tick gave it a memory: a
  replaced file keeps its old bytes, the panel can see every version, and a restore brings an old
  one back *as a new version* rather than by rewriting history.
- **The migration the plan assumed already existed.** The last tick's handover note said
  "the `media_versions` table exists". It did not — `0025` created folders, browser columns and
  the trash, and nothing had ever written a version row. So slice 2 ships `0026`, which creates
  the table and backfills version 1 for every existing file, **copying `created_at`** rather than
  stamping `now()`. A history that starts at the migration date is a lie about when the file
  arrived, and it is exactly the kind of lie that is invisible for a year.
- **Three rules, each a place a shortcut produces a plausible wrong answer.**
  1. **A version is append-only.** A restore *copies* the old bytes to a new key and appends the
     copy. Rewriting a row would make "what did this file look like on day 3" depend on whether
     anybody took a shortcut in between.
  2. **The number comes from the database.** `next_version` reads `max(version)` under
     `for update` on the `media` row — a *scalar subquery*, because `FOR UPDATE` on an aggregate
     is a no-op in PostgreSQL. Reading the max in Rust would open a window between two reads and
     let two concurrent replaces both claim 4, which surfaces as a "duplicate key" error that
     names the index and not the cause.
  3. **A number is never reused.** A pruned version leaves a hole.
- **The transaction is opened by the crate, not the route.** This was fought out with the
  compiler: a route-held `sqlx::Transaction` surfaces `sqlx::Error` where everything else in
  `omnion_media` is a `MediaError`, and `ApiError` has `From` for the latter but deliberately
  **not** for the former. `omnion_media::begin_version` / `commit_version` hand back only
  `MediaError`, which is the honest boundary: the library owns the transaction because the
  guarantee rule 2 exists for spans it.
- **The header probe reads 64 KB, not the file.** `crates/media/probe.rs` pulls dimensions,
  duration and page count out of the *header* for PNG, GIF, JPEG, BMP, TIFF, WebP (all three
  containers), MP4/QuickTime, WebM, WAV, MP3, Ogg and PDF. A 4 GB video upload must not cost a
  full read to learn it is 12 minutes long. Every extractor answers "I do not know" rather than
  guessing — a wrong dimension breaks every layout that reads it and is not obviously wrong once
  it is stored. Two findings the unit tests forced out: a WebP canvas stored as `0` is a corrupt
  header, **not** a one-pixel image (reading `0 + 1` would put a 1×1 box on screen for a file
  that has no size), and one blanket 30-byte minimum across the three WebP containers refuses a
  short-but-complete `VP8L` header.
- **The walk corrected a test that had been asserting a route which never existed.** The walk
  read the current bytes from `/api/v1/media/files/{id}/raw` and got an empty body: the file
  manager's *listing* is `/media/files`, the read is `/media/{id}/raw`, and no route was ever
  registered at the address the test used. Three more corrections came out of the same run — the
  404 is `media_not_found` (not `file_not_found`), an empty upload answers `invalid_request`
  (not `file_empty`), and the history reads **newest first**, so a check written against an
  assumed oldest-first order fails on a correct response.
- **The fixture leaked objects until it read the union.** Cleanup read `media.storage_key`, but a
  replace *moves* that column to the new key — the old one is named only by the history, so every
  replaced version's object stayed in the bucket. A test cleanup that misses them is a slow leak
  that nobody notices for a month.
- **Proof.** `cargo test -p omnion-media --lib` → **46 tests, 0 failures** (24 new, mostly header
  probes and the version key rules). `cargo test -p omnion-api --lib` → **109 tests, 0 failures**.
  `cargo test -p omnion-api --test media` against `omnion_test_main` → **11 walks, 0 failures**,
  over the real router: a replace leaves version 1 downloadable and **byte-identical** (compared
  as bytes, not as a length — a length check would pass by accident on an overwrite), the row
  points at the version it serves, the three versions own three keys, a download of an old
  version is an attachment named `hero-v1.png`, a restore appends version 3 with version 1's
  checksum while version 2 is untouched, and the routes refuse without a session, without
  `media.read`, and name a missing version by number. `pnpm --filter @omnion/admin typecheck`
  green. The QA pass ran on the default stack.
- **Environment note.** `/mnt/apopic` was at 99 % (610 MB free) when the tests finished; this
  worktree's `target/debug/incremental` returned 1.2 GB and the unclaimed `omnion-w5`/`omnion-w6`
  worktrees' `target/` returned a further 2.7 GB. **Owner action:** those worktrees hold build
  artefacts for waves nobody has started; they will fill the image again.
- **Next.** Slice 3 — transformation presets with a content-addressed cache, per-site storage
  settings with a connection test, the CDN purge hook, share links and duplicate detection with
  merge. Also still open in slice 2: the Usage and Activity tabs, HTTP range requests on the
  serve path, and EXIF extraction.

## 2026-09-28 — REQ-125 closes: a merge made the branch unbootable, and the gate found four real defects

- **What this tick was.** The close gate for REQ-125, plus everything the gate had been hiding.
  Two things blocked it before it could run at all, and once it ran it found four defects in the
  audit screen that the Rust suite and the panel build were both green through.
- **The branch could not boot, and no single branch was at fault.** This file carried
  `0027_deployment_lease_revocation.sql`; `origin/main` shipped `0027_media_transforms.sql` for
  REQ-010. Each branch was internally consistent and the union was not — sqlx keys a migration on
  version *and* checksum, so the API refused to start with `migration 27 was previously applied but
  has been modified`. Renumbered to `0033`, the first slot free in all seven worktrees. The
  duplicate check is one line and has to run after every merge, not only when a file is written:
  `ls database/migrations/*.sql | sed 's/_.*//' | sort | uniq -d`.
- **A crashed API is a race with the next pass.** `run.sh` dropped the database and restarted the
  API *afterwards*, and the crash-looping process reconnected the instant the database returned,
  applying the migration set it had been compiled with. The rebuilt binary then found its
  predecessor's checksums. The symptom reads like a corrupt database; it is a race. One line —
  stop this stack's API before the reset — and `pm2 stop` rather than `delete` so the existing
  restart branch keeps the right environment.
- **The whole-box walk is not evidence on a shared box.** It ran twice and died both times at the
  same place (`analytics-*`, then the palette) with `Target page, context or browser has been
  closed` and **no summary.json** — an infrastructure abort, not a verdict. Three other writers were
  driving their own Chromium at the time (30 chrome processes, 1 G free of 32 G). The screen was
  therefore measured by a scoped depth pass, which is a harness addition rather than a copy: the
  walkthrough's depth passes are now exported behind a `require.main` guard and
  `secrets-audit-depth.cjs` drives the same assertions for one screen in a minute.
- **The four defects the depth pass found, none of which any other gate could see:**
  1. **Three filters that were dead.** The action pills, the request-id box and the address box each
     kept their own state; the row list read none of them. A pill turned `aria-pressed` on and the
     table underneath did not move. Only the text search was wired — the walk's own numbers show
     it: `before 0, after 0, pressed true`.
  2. **Escape stranded the keyboard.** It closed the drawer but left focus in the filter input, so
     the handler's `typing` guard swallowed `f`, `a` and `/` for the rest of the visit. The first
     sequence a keyboard user tries — `/`, Escape, `f` — silently did nothing after the first key.
  3. **A refusal that wrote no row.** `POST /secret-leases/{id}/redeem` with no deployment key
     answered 401 with a request id and wrote nothing, while every other refusal in that handler
     wrote a denial row. The operator holding that id had no row to land on — the one case the
     request id exists to prevent. It cannot use `record_use` (that needs a key id), so it writes
     the audit row directly, with the id in the COLUMN.
  4. **My own driver measured the wrong server first.** The walkthrough resolves its base URL from
     `--url` and silently defaults to :3100 — the main writer's stack. The first two depth runs
     reported "0 rows, export 404, no fixture leaked" and looked like a pass against a broken
     screen; they were a 404 page and another branch's API. The driver now compares the port it was
     given against the port the module resolved and refuses to run when they differ.
- **Proof.** `cargo test -p omnion-secrets` 53/53 · `cargo test -p omnion-api --test secret_audit`
  2/2 (the second test is the denial row, asserting both that it exists and that the screen's own
  `?request_id=` filter returns it — a row the filter cannot reach is as useless as no row) ·
  `pnpm typecheck` 2/2 · depth pass on 18085/3105/3205: 5 rows, action filter **5 → 1**, request-id
  join lands on the denial row (36-char id), export 200 with no fixture value and no masked
  fragment in the feed, 0 console errors, and the screenshot shows the chip selected with the one
  matching row beneath it.
- **The acknowledge is proved over the router, not in the browser.** Clearing a flag needs one to
  exist, and a flag is raised by a real reveal, which needs the operator key — the one thing a
  walkthrough has no legitimate way to hold. `secret_audit.rs` proves the raise and that the
  acknowledge persists and reports `already_acknowledged` on a second click.
- **Environment.** `/mnt/apopic` sat at 99–100% (779 M); freed only this worktree's own
  `qa-artifacts/`. `target/` is still a symlink into `/dev/shm/omnion-w6-target`, which is why the
  Rust gates survived the incident at all. `omnion_w6_dev` had to be dropped and recreated after
  the renumber: it held the old 0027 checksum and every test failed with `VersionMismatch(27)`
  before reaching an assertion.
- **Next.** REQ-126 (observability stack), slice 1: the log schema crate, the middleware that binds
  request id and user/org context, worker propagation, the shared redaction pass and the bounded
  log explorer screen.

## 2026-09-28 — REQ-010 slice 3 (transformations), a preset that produces real pixels

- **What this tick was.** Slices 1 and 2 gave the library a file system and a memory. This one
  gave it *derivatives*: a page asks for `?preset=card` and gets the same pixels every time,
  built on the first request and addressed by a hash of its inputs.
- **The dependency the plan did not mention.** A preset has to *produce* pixels, which means
  decoding, resampling and re-encoding. The workspace had no image crate, so this tick adds
  `image` (png/jpeg/webp only — the three codecs a preset can emit). Shelling out to a binary
  was the alternative and was rejected: it makes the API's correctness depend on what happens to
  be installed on the host, and the test suite would skip itself on a machine without it.
- **Two fits are not one fit.** `cover` crops and `contain` letterboxes, and the first version
  gave both the same resampler. It produced a correctly-sized *crop*: it passes a square-crop
  assertion and is wrong on every non-square source, which is most of them. A `contain` result is
  now pasted onto a canvas of the box's size, so a thumbnail is a stable 320×320 rather than a
  320×180 that shifts the layout every time a differently-shaped image is uploaded.
- **A request never enlarges.** A 2400px request against a 1200px source is refused with an
  explanation instead of being answered with a blurry upscale that is *larger* than the original.
  The check is `>`, not `>=`: asking for exactly the source's own size is the identity, and a
  template that names the same number twice is not a mistake. The unit test forced this — the
  first version refused the identity too, which would have broken the seeded `standard` preset on
  a 1200×630 hero.
- **The cache key is a hash of the definition, not of (file, preset).** A pair lookup would serve
  stale pixels after an edit, because the pair is unchanged while the definition moved. With a
  key lookup, an edit produces a key nobody has seen, so the old entry becomes *unreachable*
  rather than *wrong* — and the response may honestly say `max-age=31536000, immutable`.
  Quality is in the key, and that is the field people forget.
- **Three defects the real router found that a unit test on `transform_bytes` could not.**
  1. The derivative header carried the **object key** where the identity belongs. The two are
     different strings that both appear in the module, and the response builder took one
     parameter where it needed two — so a caller that read the header and looked it up in
     `media_derivatives.cache_key` found nothing. A header that looks like an identifier and is
     not one is worse than none. Both are now fields of a struct, because three positional
     `&str`s is the shape that produced the bug.
  2. **A site created after the migration got no `standard` preset.** The `0027` seed covers the
     sites that existed when it ran, so a page already asking for `?preset=standard` would
     silently fall back to full-size originals — on new sites only, which is exactly where nobody
     is looking. It cannot be fixed in the migration, because the gap is between "the migration
     ran" and "somebody creates a site", and it cannot be fixed in the create path either:
     onboarding, the tenancy API and a future import all insert the row themselves. It is a
     trigger (`0028`), which is the only place guaranteed to see every site.
  3. A test asserting **"the first call builds" passes once and fails for ever after.** The row
     is keyed by the source bytes, and a re-run reproduces them exactly, so the second run is a
     cache hit. The assertion now checks the answer is correct either way and that the key is
     stable — the property that actually matters.
- **Proof.** `cargo test -p omnion-media --lib` → **78 tests, 0 failures** (32 new). Five walks
  over the real router in `--test media_transform` → **0 failures**: the bytes are compared *as
  bytes* and decoded again (a length check passes by accident on an overwrite), the second
  request is byte-identical to the first, the object is read back out of the store and compared
  against what was served, the old row survives an edit, a delete cascades the cache away, an
  unknown preset returns the original *byte for byte* with no derivative key, an SVG answers
  `not_transformable` naming its type, and every preset field error names the field that caused
  it. The pre-existing `--test media` → **11 walks, 0 failures**, unchanged, against the raw route
  that now takes a query parameter. `cargo test -p omnion-permissions --lib` → 62 pass.
  `pnpm --filter @omnion/admin typecheck` green.
- **The QA pass (`bash scripts/qa/run.sh`, default stack) — clean for this slice.** 954 clicks,
  988 screenshots, the new `/media/settings` route walked and clicked (28 elements), and the depth
  pass drove it: created a preset, submitted an out-of-range quality and **the field error named
  it**. Vision review returned **0 high / 0 medium / 0 low**. The page's own diagnostics read
  *overflow: no · offscreen: 0 · broken images: 0 · low contrast: 0 · unlabeled inputs: 0 ·
  duplicate ids: 0 · h1: 1*. The four high findings the run reports are the walkthrough's **own
  deliberate error-state probes** — `/media?folder=nonexistent-folder` and the 400/404 they
  produce — none of them from this slice.
- **Two things the pass taught about this slice's own screen.** The seeded `standard` preset *is*
  present on a QA site (checked directly in `omnion_qa`, and the trigger in `0028` fires for a
  site created afterwards), so the walkthrough's `seeded: 0` was its own text match, not a gap —
  which is why the number was checked against the database rather than believed. And the preset
  example URL is a `<code>`, not an anchor: the first depth pass looked for `a[href^="/api/v1/
  media/"]`, found none, and reported "no preset example URL" for a screen that had one on it. An
  `<a>` pointing at a placeholder id would only have proven a 404 — the same mistake the route
  inventory already made once with `/media/files`. The pass now reads the query the screen
  actually renders and builds a real URL with a real file id.
- **A compiler lesson, fought out over a long wrong turn.** Every guarded route in this codebase
  is written `get(handler).layer(guards::require(...))`, and the new routes refused to compile
  with a bare `type annotations needed for MethodRouter<AppState, _>`. The guard's service impl
  requires the inner service's `Error = Infallible`, and inference cannot pick `Infallible` out of
  the several `From<Infallible>` impls in scope. Every existing route gets away with it because
  the *later* `.merge()`/`.route()` calls in the same chain pin the type. The fix is a
  `MethodRouter<AppState, Infallible>` annotation on the three new bindings — the same fix the
  compiler suggested and that reading the guard's own bound would have given in one minute.
- **Environment.** `/` was at 99 % and `/mnt/apopic` at 100 % during the run — MinIO refused
  writes with `XMinioStorageFull` and three walks failed on a storage error that had nothing to do
  with the code. Reclaiming `omnion-live/target` and `omnion-w5/target` (worktrees for waves
  nobody has started) plus this one's stale `deps` binaries returned ~4 GB. **Owner action:** the
  eight worktrees under `/mnt/apopic` hold ~30 GB of `target/`, and this is the second tick in a
  row that has had to delete another loop's build cache to finish its own tests.
- **Next.** Slice 3 continues — per-site storage settings with a connection test and public base
  URL, the CDN purge hook to REQ-011, share links with expiry and password, duplicate detection
  with merge. Also still open: EXIF (slice 2), HTTP range requests on the serve path, and the
  Usage and Activity tabs, which need `media_references` and arrive with slice 4.

## 2026-09-28 — REQ-126 slice 1: the log schema, the edge, and the redaction pass

- **What shipped.** `crates/telemetry` (`schema` / `context` / `redact` / `store`), migration
  `0035_observability_logs.sql`, the `request_context` middleware on the outer router, the guard's
  actor binding, the `observability.*` permission family, and `/api/v1/observability/logs` with
  `/logs/requests/{id}` and `GET|PUT /logs/settings`. **`c7d17e6` · `5c7b06e` · `e3f1209`**.
- **Proof.** `cargo test -p omnion-telemetry` 35/35 · `cargo test -p omnion-permissions` 63/63 ·
  `cargo test -p omnion-api --lib` 125/125 · `cargo test -p omnion-api --test observability_logs`
  3/3 against `omnion_w6_dev` · `pnpm typecheck` 2/2.
- **The three defects only the integration walk could see, and the fourth GitHub found:**
  1. **`user_id` was structurally null on every row.** The route guard inserts the resolved
     session into the **request's** extensions, and the request is consumed by the time the edge
     middleware can look — a mutation made deep in the chain never propagates up to an outer
     layer. Both the obvious sources were wrong (`response.extensions()` and a pre-call snapshot
     of `request.extensions()`), and cargo, typecheck and the unit tests were all green
     throughout. The context is now a shared cell the guard *writes into* and the middleware
     *reads back*, which is also what the request describes when it says the actor is bound
     "after authentication".
  2. **`route` was null too, for the same reason** — `MatchedPath` is inserted the same way, so
     a template column that is always empty is a filter nobody can select. The route is now read
     from the request before `next.run` consumes it.
  3. **Reading the context back *outside* the scope** produced a line with a null request id that
     no response header could ever match. A task-local only exists while its scope is installed;
     25 seconds of bounded retrying found nothing before that was spotted as the cause rather
     than treated as a flake.
  4. **GitHub's push protection rejected the whole branch** over an `xoxb-…` literal in a test
     fixture. The block was correct: nothing distinguishes a redacted fixture from a live key by
     inspection, and "allow this secret once" is precisely the decision not to make casually. The
     fixtures are now *built* from a prefix and a filler. The fix had to be an **amend of the
     original commit** — a later commit does not remove a literal that is already in the history,
     and `752b8e9` had to be rewritten because it had never been pushed.
- **Why `git reset --soft origin/wave6` was the wrong instinct here.** It un-staged the merge of
  `origin/main` and the working tree then held the main writer's uncommitted REQ-010 files
  (`media_settings`, `media_transform`, `0028`/`0029`), which a careless `git add -A` would have
  committed into my branch. Recovery was: back up my 18 files, `reset --hard` back to the merge
  commit, restore the other writer's files *from that commit* (deleting them would have reverted
  his work), then recommit only my paths. **A soft reset is not a "undo the last commits"
  operation once a merge is in the history — check what the tree gained, not what it lost.**
- **Environment.** `/mnt/apopic` 95% (six writers live), `/` at 99% (2.1 G). `target/` stayed
  symlinked into `/dev/shm/omnion-w6-target` (14 G free), which is the only reason the Rust gates
  ran at all. Migration slot 0035, because wave 4 holds 0034.
- **Not in this slice, and said so in the request file rather than ticked:** the panel's log
  explorer screen, and the temporary per-module level raise with its automatic expiry. The
  criteria for the settings screen stay unticked for the same reason.
- **Next.** REQ-126 slice 2 — the metric registry with the documented families, the cardinality
  budget enforced at registration, `GET /metrics` in the Prometheus text format, the catalogue
  seeded from the registry, and the catalogue and chart screen.
