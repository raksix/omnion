//! HTTP route table for the Omnion API.
//!
//! API routes are versioned under `/api/v1` from the first release; operational endpoints
//! (`/healthz`, `/readyz`) stay unversioned so probes never depend on the API version.
//!
//! Routes that change state or read privileged data carry a permission guard
//! (`crate::guards::require`); `GET /api/v1/me` and sign-in/out stay open to any signed-in
//! account, and `GET /api/v1/iam/effective-permissions` resolves the caller's own set without a
//! permission because it answers "what may I do here".
//!
//! The tenancy surface (`/organizations`, `/sites`) is guarded by the `organizations.*`,
//! `sites.*` and `domains.manage` permissions and additionally scoped in the handlers
//! (`crate::scope`): organization accounts only ever see and change their own organization.
//!
//! The content surface (`/pages`) is guarded by the `content.pages.*` permissions; its
//! handlers apply the same scope rule through the site a page belongs to.
//!
//! The public surface (`/public`) is the one unauthenticated read route of the API: it serves
//! published content to the public site renderer (`apps/web`) and resolves the addressed site
//! from the request — see `crate::routes::public` for the resolution order.
//!
//! The media surface (`/media`) is the library a site's content points at: uploads are guarded
//! by `media.upload`, reads by `media.read` and removals by `media.delete`, all scoped through
//! the site the file belongs to. Its bytes are served twice — on the panel surface behind the
//! session and on the public surface for the renderer — see `crate::routes::media`.
//!
//! The workflow surface (`/workflows`, `/workflow-executions`) is the automation engine of P09:
//! definitions are read with `workflows.read`, written with `workflows.manage`, started and
//! cancelled with `workflows.run` — see `crate::routes::workflows`. The background runner that
//! advances the runs lives in `crate::workflow_runner`.
//!
//! The onboarding surface (`/onboarding`) is the first-run flow of a fresh installation
//! (REQ-050, P10): it carries no permission guard because there is nothing to check against
//! until an account exists — the flow itself decides who may act (see
//! `crate::routes::onboarding`).
//!
//! The AI Hub surface (`/ai`) is the platform's door to AI (docs/06-AI-HUB.md, P11): providers
//! and the model registry are read with `ai.providers.read` and written with
//! `ai.providers.manage`, and `POST /ai/chat` answers as `text/event-stream` behind the
//! `ai.chat` key — using the platform's AI and connecting a provider are separate powers. See
//! `crate::routes::ai`.
//!
//! The events and webhooks surface (`/webhooks`, `/events`) is the platform's own bus
//! (docs/01-VISION.md §13, P12): endpoints are read with `webhooks.read` and written with
//! `webhooks.manage`, the queue history of one endpoint rides the read key, and the event feed
//! is read with `events.read`. Publishing a page records `page.published` and queues a signed
//! delivery per subscribed endpoint; the worker that sends them lives in `crate::event_runner`.
//! See `crate::routes::webhooks`.
//!
//! The automation surface (`/automations`) is trigger → condition → action (docs/requests/
//! REQ-003, P13): a rule is a workflow whose trigger is an event, so it rides the workflow
//! permission keys and the background matcher in `crate::automation_runner` starts one durably
//! stepped run per match — the same engine P09's manual and scheduled runs use. The vocabulary a
//! rule is written in is closed and readable at `/automations/catalogue`; the actions that touch
//! the world live in `omnion-automation` (see `crate::workflow_runner`, which installs them).
//!
//! The search surface (`/search`, `/search/suggest`, `/search/status`, `/search/reindex`) is the
//! platform's one search box over the `omnion-search` index (docs/requests/REQ-002): searching
//! is `search.read` — the box every signed-in account holds — while the answer is narrowed to
//! the providers whose own read permissions the caller carries, and rebuilding the index is the
//! separate `search.manage`. The indexer that keeps the documents fresh from the event bus is
//! `crate::search_runner`. See `crate::routes::search`.
